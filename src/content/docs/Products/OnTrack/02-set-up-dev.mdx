Welcome to the comprehensive guide for setting up the OnTrack (Doubtfire) Development Environment.
Follow these steps carefully to ensure a smooth configuration.

## Step 1: Overview

In this tutorial, we will set up the OnTrack (Doubtfire) Development Environment. Ensure you are
familiar with the repositories, as you’ll be working with the Thoth-Tech versions, not the original
Doubtfire LMS repositories.

---

## Step 2: Pre-Requisites

Before proceeding, ensure the following are installed and set up:

- **Docker**: Installed and running in the background.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Your code editor.
- **Git**: Installed for version control.
- **GitHub Account**: Required to fork and access repositories.

---

## Step 3: Restart if Needed

If you have faced errors in previous setup attempts, start from scratch. Follow this tutorial
step-by-step to avoid missing any crucial details.

---

## Step 4: Accessing the Thoth-Tech Repository

Navigate to the Thoth-Tech GitHub organization and locate these repositories:

- **doubtfire-deploy**
- **doubtfire-api**
- **doubtfire-web**

Make sure you are using the Thoth-Tech versions of these repositories.

---

## Step 5: Fork the `doubtfire-deploy` Repository

1. Open the `doubtfire-deploy` repository under Thoth-Tech.
2. Click on the **Fork** button in the top-right corner.
3. **Important**: Untick the checkbox for "Copy the main branch only" to include the development
   branch.
4. Click **Create Fork**.

---

## Step 6: Repeat for `doubtfire-api` and `doubtfire-web`

Repeat the forking process for these repositories:

- **doubtfire-api**
- **doubtfire-web**

Ensure the development branch is included by unticking "Copy the main branch only".

## Step 7: Open the Terminal and Navigate to Your Folder

1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal).
2. Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you want to store the repository. Example:

```bash
cd dev
```

---

## Step 8: Clone the Repository

Clone the `doubtfire-deploy` repository along with its submodules:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/<your-username>/doubtfire-deploy.git
```

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username. Example:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/aditya993388/doubtfire-deploy.git
```

---

## Step 9: Wait for the Cloning Process

The terminal will display the cloning progress for the repository and its submodules (e.g.,
`doubtfire-api`, `doubtfire-overseer`, `doubtfire-web`). Wait until the process completes.

---

## Step 10: Navigate into the Cloned Repository

Navigate into the cloned repository:

```bash
cd doubtfire-deploy
```

---

## Step 11: Check Current Remote Settings

Verify the current remote settings:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Ensure only the `origin` is set, pointing to your forked repository.

---

## Step 12: Add the Upstream Remote

Add the upstream remote to point to the Thoth-Tech repository:

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/thoth-tech/doubtfire-deploy.git
```

This ensures that upstream points to the Thoth-Tech version, not the original LMS repository.

---

![Step ](images/image-three.PNG)

## Step 13: Verify Remote Settings

Verify the upstream remote setup:

```bash
git remote -v
```

Ensure both `origin` and `upstream` are listed correctly:

- **Origin**: Points to your forked repository.
- **Upstream**: Points to Thoth-Tech’s repository.

---

![Step ](images/image-four.PNG)

## Step 14: Switch to the Development Branch

By default, the repository is on the `main` branch. Switch to the `development` branch:

```bash
git switch development
```

Verify the switch by running:

```bash
git branch
```

The `*` symbol next to `development` confirms you are on the correct branch.

### Step 27: Running the Front-End and Back-End Applications

- At this stage, the front-end application is running on the left terminal, while the back-end
  (server) is active on the right terminal.
- Note: It's common to encounter errors during the first run of the front-end. These may relate to
  missing dependencies or configuration conflicts.
- Review the error messages carefully. For issues like dependency conflicts, try resolving them with
  appropriate commands such as `npm install` or check the error log paths mentioned in the terminal
  for further details.
