OnTrack Development Setup Guide - 2025T3  
Step-by-Step Tutorial

## 2. INSTALLING DOCKER DESKTOP

Docker Desktop is essential for running the OnTrack development container.

Steps:
- Download Docker Desktop from docker.com

- For Windows users:
- Docker Desktop installation includes Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)
- If WSL2 isn't automatically installed, follow the setup wizard
- Docker Desktop installs WSL (aka whistle) as part of the process

- Complete the installation and restart your computer if prompted

- Start Docker Desktop - ensure it's running before proceeding

- Verify installation by opening a terminal and running:
docker --version

IMPORTANT: Keep Docker Desktop running throughout the development process.

## 3. FORKING THE REQUIRED REPOSITORIES

OnTrack consists of three main repositories that need to be forked from Doubtfire LMS:

Required Repositories:
a) doubtfire-deploy
- Contains docker-compose configuration
- Main deployment setup

b) doubtfire-api
- Backend API (Ruby on Rails)
- Contains the Ruby application code

c) doubtfire-web
- Frontend application (Angular)
- Contains the user interface

Optional (for testing):
d) doubtfire-lti (for LTI integration testing)

How to Fork:
- Navigate to the Thoth Tech repository store on
GitHub: https://github.com/thoth-tech/

- For each repository (deploy, api, web):
a. Go to the repository page
b. Ensure you're on the 'development' branch initially
c. Click the 'Fork' button in the top-right
d. Keep all default settings
e. UNCHECK 'Copy the main branch only' if you see it
f. Click 'Create fork'

- GitHub will create your own copy of the repository

- Your forked repositories will appear at:
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/doubtfire-deploy
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/doubtfire-api
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/doubtfire-web

## 4. PULLING THE DOCKER IMAGE

Before starting development, pull the required Docker image from Docker Hub.
The Docker image contains all dependencies for OnTrack development.

Steps:

- Open Docker Desktop terminal (recommended for Windows users)
- In Docker Desktop, click the terminal icon at the bottom
- This ensures proper line endings on Windows

- Run the following command:
docker pull lmsdoubtfire/formatif-dev-container:10.0.0-14

Note: The version number (10.0.0-14) comes from the docker-compose.yaml file
in the doubtfire-deploy repository

- This will download all dependencies - it may take several minutes

- Verify the image was pulled:
docker images
You should see: lmsdoubtfire/doubtfire-dev-container:10.0.0-14

Where to find the image version:
- Open doubtfire-deploy/docker-compose.yaml
- Look under 'services' > 'image'
- The format is: lmsdoubtfire/doubtfire-dev-container:[version]

## 5. CLONING REPOSITORIES LOCALLY

Now clone your forked repositories to your local machine.

Steps:
- Open your terminal (PowerShell on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux)

- Navigate to your preferred directory:
cd ~ (goes to home directory)
or
cd C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\Documents\Projects

- Clone doubtfire-deploy first:
a. Go to your forked doubtfire-deploy on GitHub
b. Click the green 'Code' button
c. Copy the HTTPS URL (or SSH if you've set it up)
d. In terminal, run:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/doubtfire-deploy.git

- Navigate into the directory:
cd doubtfire-deploy

- Clone doubtfire-api:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/doubtfire-api.git

- Clone doubtfire-web:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/doubtfire-web.git

- (Optional) Clone doubtfire-lti if you're testing LTI:
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/doubtfire-lti.git

- Verify your structure:
You should now have:
doubtfire-deploy/
├── doubtfire-api/
├── doubtfire-web/
└── doubtfire-lti/ (optional)

## 6. SETTING UP GIT REMOTES

Git remotes allow you to sync with both your fork (origin) and the ThothTech repository
(upstream).

Understanding Remotes:
- origin: Your forked repository on GitHub
- upstream: ThothTech's repository (downstream from Doubtfire LMS)

Steps for doubtfire-deploy:
- Check current remotes:
git remote -v

You'll see only 'origin' pointing to your fork

- Add ThothTech as upstream:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/thothtech/doubtfire-deploy.git

Verify:
git remote -v

You should now see:
origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/doubtfire-deploy.git
upstream https://github.com/thothtech/doubtfire-deploy.git

Repeat for doubtfire-api:

- Navigate to API directory:
cd doubtfire-api

- Add upstream remote:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/thothtech/doubtfire-api.git

Verify:
git remote -v

Repeat for doubtfire-web:

- Navigate to web directory:
cd ../doubtfire-web

- Add upstream remote:
git remote add upstream https://github.com/thothtech/doubtfire-web.git

Verify:
git remote -v

- Return to parent directory:
cd ..

## 7. SWITCHING TO THE CORRECT BRANCH

IMPORTANT: You must work on the 10.0.x branch, not the main or development branch.

For doubtfire-deploy:
- Check current branch:
git branch

- Switch to 10.0.x branch:
git checkout 10.0.x

- Pull latest changes:
git pull

- Check git status:
git status

For doubtfire-api:

- Navigate to API:
cd doubtfire-api

- Switch branch:
git checkout 10.0.x

- Pull latest:
git pull

Verify:
git status

For doubtfire-web:

- Navigate to web:
cd ../doubtfire-web

- Switch branch:
git checkout 10.0.x

- Pull latest:
git pull

Verify:
git status

- Return to deploy directory:
cd ..

- Fetch all latest changes (optional but recommended):
git fetch

## 8. OPENING IN VS CODE

Now open the doubtfire-deploy directory in VS Code to start the development container.

Steps:
- From the doubtfire-deploy directory in terminal:
code .

- Alternative method:
- Open VS Code manually
- File > Open Folder
- Navigate to and select the doubtfire-deploy folder

## 9. STARTING THE DEVELOPMENT CONTAINER

The development container runs all OnTrack services inside Docker.

Automatic Method:
- VS Code should detect the .devcontainer configuration
- A popup will appear: "Reopen in Container"
- Click "Reopen in Container"

Manual Method:
- Press Ctrl+Shift+P (Cmd+Shift+P on Mac)
- Type: "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"
- Select this option

## 10. ACCESSING THE APPLICATION

Once the container is running, OnTrack will be accessible via your web browser.

Finding Your Ports:
- localhost:4200 - OnTrack Frontend (Angular)
- localhost:3000 - OnTrack API (Ruby on Rails)

Default admin credentials:
- Username: admin
- Password: password

## 11. TROUBLESHOOTING

Issue: Docker Desktop not running  
Solution:
- Open Docker Desktop
- Wait for it to fully start
- Reopen container in VS Code

Issue: Wrong branch  
Solution:
- git checkout 10.0.x

Issue: CSS not loading  
Solution:
- Wait a few minutes
- Refresh the page

## CONCLUSION

You have now successfully set up the OnTrack development environment.
