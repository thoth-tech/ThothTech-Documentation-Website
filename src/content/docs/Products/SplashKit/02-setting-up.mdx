## Install Necessary Tools

First things first, you'll need to install the necessary tools to get started working within
SplashKit.io.

### 1. Install GIT

Git is essential for version control, allowing you to clone repositories, commit changes, and
collaborate. Before you start, ensure you have Git installed on your system.

- Windows: Download Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and run the installer `.exe`
  file.
- macOS: Git should already be installed, but you can install it with [homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
  using the following command in your terminal:

  ```shell
  brew install git
  ```

- Linux: Install using the package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or Debian, run the following
  command:

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get install git
  ```

After installation, verify the installation with:

```shell
git --version
```

### 2. Download and Install VS Code

- Download VS Code: Visit the official
  [VS Code download page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and select the appropriate
  installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

- Install VS Code:

  - Windows: Run the downloaded `.exe` file and follow the installation wizard.
  - macOS: Open the `.dmg` file and drag the Visual Studio Code icon to the Applications folder.
  - Linux: Install using the appropriate package manager or by downloading the `.deb` or `.rpm`
    package from the website.

- Launch VS Code: Once installed, launch Visual Studio Code.

### 3. Download and Install Node.js

- Download Node.js: Go to the official
  [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) and download the LTS version for
  your operating system.
- Install Node.js:

  - Windows: Run the downloaded `.msi` file and follow the installation wizard.
  - macOS: Open the `.pkg` file and follow the instructions.
  - Linux: You can use a package manager or install it via NodeSource.

- Verify Installation: Open a terminal (or command prompt) and check if Node.js is installed
  correctly by running the following command:

  ```shell
  node -v
  ```

  This should return the version number of Node.js.

  Also, verify the installation of npm (Node Package Manager) by running the following command:

  ```shell
  npm -v
  ```

  This should return the version of npm installed.

### 4. Install SplashKit

Head to the [SplashKit.io](https://splashkit.io/) website and follow the instructions for your
specific operating system to install SplashKit.

### 5. Install Docker

Head to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and install Docker for your specific
operating system.

### 6. Install Extensions for VS Code

- Node.js Extension: Install the Node.js extension in VS Code for better integration:

  - Open VS Code and go to the Extensions sidebar.
  - Search for "Node.js Extension Pack" and install it.

- GitHub Extension: This allows you to interact with GitHub directly from VS Code.:
  - In the Extensions sidebar, search for "GitHub Pull Requests and Issues" and install it.

### 7. Install Dependencies

- Once the project is cloned, navigate to the Project Directory: In the terminal, change into the
  cloned project directory:

  ```shell
  cd <project-directory>
  ```

  Replace `<project-directory>` with your actual folder name.

- Install Node Dependencies:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

This will install all the necessary packages listed in the `package.json` file.

### 8. Installing WSL

<Aside>The next steps are only required for SplashKit Core members</Aside>
WSL is a built-in Linux distribution virtual machine for Windows. splashkit-core will be installed
to the Linux distribution. The official SplashKit installation instructions can be found here:
[Windows (WSL) Installation Overview](https://splashkit.io/installation/windows-wsl).

### 9. Installing Windows Terminal (optional)

Windows Terminal is an updated Command Prompt with many useful features. It is not mandatory to
install, however it is recommended due to its ease of use. More information about Windows Terminal
can be found here: [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).It can be
installed through the Microsoft Store.

By default, new tabs will open as a Command Prompt, with WSL terminals being accessible with the
down-arrow. Since WSL will be used so frequently, there is the option to change the default tab to
WSL. Open the settings by clicking the down arrow and selecting ‘Settings’. In the ‘Startup’ tab,
‘Default profile’ allows you to change the default tab type to WSL.

You are should now be ready to start contributing to your team project. Make sure you head over to
