You cannot create new programs with splashkit-core as you do when using the traditional SplashKit
library. Instead, two programs are generated which can be configured to test its functionality:
`sktest` and `skunit_tests`. They are built with CMake using a preconfigured `CMakeLists.txt` file, which builds the SplashKit library and both test programs.

### Making Changes

`sktest` is built with the .cpp files from `~/splashkit-core/coreskd/src/test/`. To add your own
tests, modify one or more of the files such as `test_animation.cpp`.

`skunit_tests` is built with the .cpp files from `~/splashkit-core/coreskd/src/test/unit_tests/`.
When it runs, all unit tests from all files in this folder are executed. Additional files can be
added to this folder if necessary. If adding a new file, copy the structure from one of the existing
unit test files. Critically, `#include "catch.hpp"` must be present in the file for it to be
compiled into `skunit_tests`. Beyond that, the hierarchy of, `TEST_CASE > SECTION > ASSERTION`
should be followed to improve readability and tracing of errors.

## Building the test project
If a change is made to the code, the build process needs to be run. This applies whether changes were made to coresdk files (such as adding new functions to SplashKit or changing existing code) or new tests were added to sktest or skunit_tests.

## Running the Test Programs

To run the test programs, open a WSL terminal and enter:

```shell
cd
cd splashkit-core/bin
```

Then for sktest:

```shell
./sktest
```

Or for skunit_tests:

```shell
./skunit_tests
```

## Running unit tests

### From the command line

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
<TabItem label="Linux/WSL">

- It's a good idea to run the unit tests in a random order so that you can confirm that they run
  indepedently of one another:

  ```shell
  cd ../../bin
  ./skunit_tests --order rand
  ```

  By default, this will only show reports for failed tests. To show reports for successful tests as
  well, use the option `--success`. More command line options can be found in
  [Catch2's documentation](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/v2.x/docs/command-line.md).

- If you want to run a specific test, or group of tests, you can do so:

  ```shell
  ./skunit_tests <test spec>
  ```

  The `test spec` can be a test name or tags and supports wildcards. For example, `*string*` would
  run all of the tests with "string" in the name.

### In VS Code

You can run tests from the Testing tab in VS Code
![Testing tab](images/run-unit-tests/1-testing-tab.png)

- Running all tests:  
  Click Run Tests. Each test will be run and the status of each can be seen in the test list after a
  test runs.  
  ![Run Tests](images/run-unit-tests/2-run-tests.png)
- Running a specific test:  
  Click Run Test next to any test on the test list to run it
