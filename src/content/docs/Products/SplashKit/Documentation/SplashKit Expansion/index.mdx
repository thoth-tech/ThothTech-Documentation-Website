## Contributing to splashkit-core

This guide will cover all the steps required to get contributing to the splashkit-core repository.
Feel free to skip steps which you have already completed or are familiar with.

If you haven't already, ensure you have setup your work environment by following the
[Setting up your environment guide](/products/splashkit/02-setting-up)

### Creating Branch

When modifying the repository, changes should be logically grouped together onto separate branches.
To create a branch, open a WSL terminal and navigate to the `splashkit-core` folder with:

```shell
cd splashkit-core
```

Check the current branch with:

```shell
git branch
```

Create a new branch using the current branch as a base:

```shell
git branch {new branch name}
```

Swap to new branch with:

```shell
git checkout {new branch name}
```

Now that a new branch is created and active, development can begin.

### Testing Changes

It is critical that changes made to splashkit-core are thoroughly tested, so that issues can be found and resolved early. When making changes to code, whether adding new functions or altering existing functions, be sure to run the existing tests and think about adding new ones to test your changes. See [the testing guide](/products/splashkit/splashkit-expansion/01-testing) to get started with testing.

### Documenting Changes

Local changes can be tested by building and running the test programs. However, once changes are to
be submitted for review, they need to be staged, committed and pushed. It is good practice to
perform multiple smaller commits with meaningful descriptions rather than a single monolithic
commit. In addition, pushing commits to GitHub provides a layer of backup in case of local machine
failure.

### Creating a Pull Request

Once you have completed work on a particular branch, a pull request (PR) can be made. At this point
there are now three relevant splashkit-core repositories at play: splashkit-core itself,
thoth-tech’s fork, and your personal fork. During trimester, PRs should be made against the
thoth-tech fork. The PR template provides a framework for how to structure the associated PR
documentation.

The following guide details how to create PRs for the SplashKit Website. The same instructions can
be used for splashkit-core by simply changing the repository name:
[How to Create a Pull Request](/products/splashkit/04-pull-request).

### Responding to Peer Reviews

If changes are requested during a PR review, pushing further commits to the same branch will
automatically be added to the PR.

### Performing Peer Reviews

A critical component to SplashKit development is the process of reviewing your peers' PRs and
providing constructive feedback. This process has been detailed in the following guide:
[A Guide to Doing Peer Reviews](/products/splashkit/06-peer-review)

### Planner Board

The planner board is used to coordinate tasks while they are being completed and reviewed. The
following guide details the procedure and etiquette which is expected while using the planner board:
