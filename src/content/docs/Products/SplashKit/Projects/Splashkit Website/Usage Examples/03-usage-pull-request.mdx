## Preparing to do a Pull Request

Before starting the pull request ensure you have followed the steps in the
[Usage Example Overview](../01-overview) guide for
creating a usage example. Ensure you have the files listed below added, with their names updated to
the function you are demonstrating.

```plaintext
write_line-1-example-oop.cs
write_line-1-example-top-level.cs
write_line-1-example-sk.cpp
write_line-1-example.py
write_line-1-example.png or .gif
write_line-1-example.txt
```

In a seperate pull request, to add to existing examples:

```plaintext
write_line-1-hello-world-beyond.cpp
```

## Creating a Pull Request

Usage examples have their own process when it comes to doing pull requests. You'll follow the same
steps on the [pull request guide](/products/splashkit/04-pull-request),
however, the destination branch needs to be changed to be **usage-examples**.

Then remove the default template in the pull request, and instead use the following template:

```shell
# Overview
Describe the example and what it demonstrates.

Splashkit Function: `function_name`

# Files Included
- [ ] Relevant title for the example (.txt)
- [ ] C++ code (SplashKit)
- [ ] C++ code (Beyond SplashKit - In separate pull request)
- [ ] C# code (Top-Level statements)
- [ ] C# code (Object-Oriented Programming)
- [ ] Python code
- [ ] Screenshot

# Usage Example Checks
- [ ] Simple, clear demonstration of the function
- [ ] Code uses Splashkit functions
- [ ] Tested in Chrome and Firefox
```

Once submitted, move the associated planner card to peer review and link the pull request. Follow
the [Planner Board Etiquette](/products/splashkit/08-planner-board) for
more details on the process.
