## Introduction

SplashKit uses [Catch2 2.x](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/tree/v2.x) as a framework for unit
tests.

Tests are written in C++ with the aid of macros from Catch2. Test files are located at:

<FileTree>

- coresdk
  - src
    - test
      - unit_test_main.cpp
      - unit*test*[name].cpp

</FileTree>

`unit_test_main.cpp` is the entry point for all unit tests. You do not need to modify this to write
your own tests or update existing ones.

The `unit_test_[name].cpp` files contain tests for related parts of SplashKit. For example,
`unit_test_utilities.cpp` has tests for SplashKit's utility functions. A test file must include the
Catch2 header file along with any other includes required:

```cpp
#include "catch.hpp"
```

## Writing a Unit Test

At a minimum, a unit test consists of a `TEST_CASE` and an assertion (usually `REQUIRE`):

```cpp
TEST_CASE("gets the number of milliseconds that have passed since the program was started", "[current_ticks]")
{
    unsigned int result = current_ticks();
    REQUIRE(result >= 0);
}
```

`TEST_CASE(name, [,tags])` defines a test case with the given name and, optionally, one or more
tags.

`REQUIRE` evaluates an expression and aborts the test as a failure if the result is false.
`REQUIRE_FALSE` is similar but fails if the expression evaluates true. There are
[other assertion macros](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2/blob/v2.x/docs/assertions.md#top) but
these are the most common.

A test may contain multiple assertions:

```cpp
TEST_CASE("random number float between 0 and 1 is generated", "[rnd]")
{
    float result = rnd();
    REQUIRE(result >= 0);
    REQUIRE(result <= 1);
}
```

You may write tests that have some common steps, such as defining a variable. You can define one or
more `SECTION(name)` inside a `TEST_CASE`. The `TEST_CASE` is run from the start for each `SECTION`.

```cpp
TEST_CASE("return a SplashKit resource of resource_kind with name filename as a string", "[file_as_string]")
{
    const resource_kind RESOURCE = resource_kind::BUNDLE_RESOURCE;
    const string RESOURCE_PATH = "blah.txt";

    SECTION("filename is a valid file")
    {
        string result = file_as_string(RESOURCE_PATH, RESOURCE);
        string expected = "BITMAP,ufo,ufo.png\n";
        REQUIRE(result == expected);
    }
    SECTION("filename is an empty string")
    {
        string result = file_as_string("", RESOURCE);
        string expected = "";
        REQUIRE(result == expected);
    }
    SECTION("filename is an invalid file")
    {
        string result = file_as_string("invalid.txt", RESOURCE);
        string expected = "";
        REQUIRE(result == expected);
    }
}
```

This test has three `SECTION`s, so the `TEST_CASE` will run three times. Each time, the `RESOURCE`
and `RESOURCE_PATH` variables will be defined.

## Running Unit Tests

### Linux / WSL

<Steps>

1. Install prerequisites

   - Update

     ```shell
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get upgrade -y
     ```

   - Install

     ```shell
     sudo apt-get install -y \
     git build-essential cmake g++ libpng-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsdl2-dev \
     libsdl2-mixer-dev libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-net-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev \
     libmikmod-dev libbz2-dev libflac-dev libvorbis-dev libwebp-dev libfreetype6-dev
     ```

2. Build test project

   ```shell
   cd projects/cmake
   cmake .
   make
   ```

3. Run unit tests

   - Running all tests

     ```shell
     cd ../../bin
     ./skunit_tests
     ```

     Example output:

     ```
     (14/04/2025) ERROR -> Invalid binary string passed to bin_to_oct: 2, returning empty string [raised in basics.cpp:340]
     (14/04/2025) ERROR -> Invalid hexadecimal string passed to hex_to_oct: G, returning empty string [raised in basics.cpp:371]
     (14/04/2025) ERROR -> Invalid octal string passed to hex_to_dec: G, returning 0 [raised in basics.cpp:305]
     (14/04/2025) ERROR -> Invalid octal string passed to oct_to_hex: 8, returning empty string [raised in basics.cpp:383]
     ===============================================================================
     All tests passed (1258 assertions in 74 test cases)
     ```

   - Running a specific test

     ```shell
     ./skunit_tests [test name or tag]
     ```

     Example output:

     ```
     ./skunit_tests "[least_common_multiple]"
     Filters: [least_common_multiple]
     ===============================================================================
     All tests passed (7 assertions in 1 test case)
     ```

</Steps>
