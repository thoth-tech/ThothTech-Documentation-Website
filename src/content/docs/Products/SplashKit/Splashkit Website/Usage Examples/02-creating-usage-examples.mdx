This guide explains how to create a usage example for the Splashkit website.

### What are Usage Examples?

Usage examples demonstrate a specific Splashkit function within a simple, small program. The goal is
to keep the program minimal while clearly showing how the function works.

For instance, the `write_line` example on the Splashkit site shows how the `write_line` function
works, with a brief explanation, program code, and a screenshot of the output.

### Steps to Create a Usage Example

An initial usage example includes 6 files:

- C++ (SplashKit) version
- C# (top-level statements) version
- C# (Object-Oriented Programming) version
- Python version
- Descriptive title for the example, in a text file
- Screenshot of the output

In a separate pull request, to add to existing examples:

- C++ (Beyond SplashKit version)

<Steps>

1. ### Choosing a Function

   The planner board has numerous usage example suggestions for various functions, however you are
   welcomed and encouraged to come up with your own creative ideas for these. Scroll through the
   [Developer Documentation](https://splashkit.io/api/) to find various functions you could use for
   the usage example, when coming up with an idea, make sure to also check to see if anyone else has
   already done it.

   The goal is to create **one usage example per function** in the SplashKit library. Building out
   these single examples for each function is the priority to round out the variety of examples
   available.

   If you come up with a creative idea for a function that already has an example, please share it
   in the SplashKit group chat or reach out to your Capstone Mentor to discuss whether it's a good
   idea to add another example for that function.

2. ### Creating The Program

   Create the program with as few lines of code as possible. You'll need to write the program in
   C++, C# (using top-level statements and OOP version), and Python, all using Splashkit. Start with
   the language you're most comfortable with, then convert it to the others.

   Note for C# to-level: Use `using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;`. For the OOP version: use
   `using SplashKitSDK;`.

   #### Example

   If C++ is your strength, begin by creating a small program like this `dec_to_hex` example:

   ```cpp
   #include "splashkit.h"

   int main()
   {
       write_line("Hello! Welcome to the decimal to hexadecimal converter.");

       // Prompt the user for a decimal input
       write_line("Please enter a decimal number:");

       // Read the input as a string
       string dec_input = read_line();

       // Convert the input string to an unsigned integer
       unsigned int dec_value = convert_to_integer(dec_input);

       // Convert the decimal value to hexadecimal format
       string hex_value = dec_to_hex(dec_value);

       // Display the result in hexadecimal format
       write_line("The decimal value in hexadecimal format is: " + hex_value);

       return 0;
   }
   ```

   This example includes meaningful comments that clearly explain each part of the program, which
   helps readers understand both the structure and function. When converting to C#, notice that the
   structure and comments are kept consistent, with syntax changes specific to the language:

   ```csharp
   using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

   WriteLine("Hello! Welcome to the decimal to hexadecimal converter.");

   // Prompt the user for a decimal input
   WriteLine("Please enter a decimal number:");

   // Read the input as a string
   string dec_input = ReadLine();

   // Convert the input string to an unsigned integer
   uint dec_value = ConvertToInteger(dec_input);

   // Convert the decimal value to hexadecimal
   string hex_value = DecToHex(dec_value);

   // Display the result
   WriteLine("The decimal value in hexadecimal format is: " + hex_value);
   ```

3. ### Explanation and Screenshot

   Provide a simple explanation and a screenshot of the program's output.

   **Title:** Decimal to Hex Converter  
   **Explanation:** This program converts a decimal value to hexadecimal using the `dec_to_hex`
   function.

   Take a screenshot of the output window and save it.

4. ### Adding these files to Splashkit Starlight.io

   Now that you're done, you should have the following 6 files when completing an initial usage
   example PR:

   - txt file
   - C++ (SplashKit) file
   - python file
   - C# (top-level statements) file
   - C# (OOP) file
   - Screenshot of the output

   In a separate pull request, to add to existing examples:

   - C++ (Beyond SplashKit version)

   Now you'll need to rename these before adding them to the Splashkit Starlight.io repo.

   #### Example

   Say you've created a `write_line` program. Rename the files as follows:

   ```plaintext
   write_line-1-example-oop.cs
   write_line-1-example-top-level.cs
   write_line-1-example-sk.cpp
   write_line-1-example.png or .gif
   write_line-1-example.py
   write_line-1-example.txt
   ```

   In a separate pull request, to add to existing examples:

   ```plaintext
   write_line-1-hello-world-beyond.cpp
   ```

   Now you can add these files to the Splashkit Starlight.io repo. If when you add them you find
   there is already some files of a usage example using this same function, then you should
   increment the number in the file name by 1. Furthermore, it is important that you use the
   function's unique global name for the files names _(This only applies for functions that are
   overloaded.)_

   Now that your files are named, add all of your files to the `usage-examples` folder under the
   appropriate function category (e.g., `terminal/`). The location in the Statlight.io repo is:

   <FileTree>

   - public
     - usage-example-files
       - animations/
       - audio/
       - camera/
       - color/
       - geometry/
       - graphics/
       - input/
       - interface/
       - json/
       - logging/
       - networking/
       - physics/
       - rasberry/
       - resources_bundles/
       - resources/
       - sprites/
       - terminal/
         - write_line-1-example-oop.cs
         - write_line-1-example-top-level.cs
         - write_line-1-example-sk.cpp
         - write_line-1-example.png
         - write_line-1-example.py
         - write_line-1-example.txt
       - timers/
       - utilities/
       - windows/

   </FileTree>

   For more information regarding the proper file naming and placement can be found within the repo
   in the `CONTRIBUTING.mdx`. The location of the file can be found here:

   <FileTree>

   - public
     - usage-examples
       - CONTRIBUTING.mdx

   </FileTree>
