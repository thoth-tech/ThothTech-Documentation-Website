## Introduction

This guide will cover all the steps required to get contributing to the splashkit-core repository.
Feel free to skip steps which you have already completed or are familiar with.

## Installing WSL

WSL is a built-in Linux distribution virtual machine for Windows. splashkit-core will be installed
to the Linux distribution. The official SplashKit installation instructions can be found here:
[Windows (WSL) Installation Overview](https://splashkit.io/installation/windows-wsl). This guide has
been tested with the default Ubuntu distribution, but others may also work.

### Installing Visual Studio Code

Once WSL has been installed to Windows, Visual Studio Code needs to be installed to WSL. The
SplashKit documentation explains the process:
[Install Visual Studio Code](https://splashkit.io/installation/windows-wsl/step-3)

### Installing Git

Now Git must be installed to WSL. Follow the Microsoft installation instructions:
[Install Git](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-git). GitHub's Git Cheat
Sheet is useful for both installation and usage of Git:
[GitHub Git Cheat Sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf)

### Installing Windows Terminal (optional)

Windows Terminal is an updated Command Prompt with many useful features. It is not mandatory to
install, however it is recommended due to its ease of use. More information about Windows Terminal
can be found here: [Windows Terminal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/).It can be
installed through the Microsoft Store.

By default, new tabs will open as a Command Prompt, with WSL terminals being accessible with the
down-arrow. Since WSL will be used so frequently, there is the option to change the default tab to
WSL. Open the settings by clicking the down arrow and selecting ‘Settings’. In the ‘Startup’ tab,
‘Default profile’ allows you to change the default tab type to WSL.

## Setting Up splashkit-core

Now that WSL is fully configured, it is time to install the splashkit-core repository.

### Forking splashkit-core Repository

A fork is a copy of a repository which allows for independent development without interfering with
the primary repository itself. To create a personal fork of splashkit-core, navigate to
[GitHub splashkit-core](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core) and click ‘Fork’. On the next
page, keep the default name and click ‘Create fork’.

The following guide for the SplashKit Website has useful information regarding forks and branches
which can be adjusted for splashkit-core by substituting repository names:
[Get Your Environment Set Up](https://thoth-tech.netlify.app/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/01-setting-up).

### Cloning splashkit-core Repository

Open a WSL terminal and change directory to your home with:

```shell
cd
```

Note that this guide clones the repository to the home directory, but feel free to move its
location. Now initiate the clone process of your fork with:

```shell
git clone --recursive -j2 https://github.com/{user name}/splashkit-core.git
```

splashkit-core contains multiple submodules (separate repositories which splashkit-core depends
upon). The `--recursive` argument ensures that the submodules are also downloaded when calling
clone. Wait for the download to complete before continuing to the next step.

## Contributing to splashkit-core

It is now time to start fixing bugs and adding functionality to splashkit-core.

### Creating Branch

When modifying the repository, changes should be logically grouped together onto separate branches.
To create a branch, open a WSL terminal and navigate to the `splashkit-core` folder with:

```shell
cd splashkit-core
```

Check the current branch with:

```shell
git branch
```

Create a new branch using the current branch as a base:

```shell
git branch {new branch name}
```

Swap to new branch with:

```shell
git checkout {new branch name}
```

Now that a new branch is created and active, development can begin.

### Building the Test Programs

You cannot create new programs with splashkit-core as you do when using the traditional SplashKit
library. Instead, two programs are generated which can be configured to test its functionality:
`sktest` and `skunit_tests`. They are built with CMake using a preconfigured `CMakeLists.txt` file.
Open a WSL terminal and enter:

```shell
cd
cd splashkit-core/projects/cmake
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
make
```

The associated macOS and Linux commands can be found here:
[CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit-core/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Running the Test Programs

To run the test programs, open a WSL terminal and enter:

```shell
cd
cd splashkit-core/bin
```

Then for sktest:

```shell
./sktest
```

Or for skunit_tests:

```shell
./skunit_tests
```

### Making Changes

`sktest` is built with the .cpp files from `~/splashkit-core/coreskd/src/test/`. To add your own
tests, modify one or more of the files such as `test_animation.cpp`.

`skunit_tests` is built with the .cpp files from `~/splashkit-core/coreskd/src/test/unit_tests/`.
When it runs, all unit tests from all files in this folder are executed. Additional files can be
added to this folder if necessary. If adding a new file, copy the structure from one of the existing
unit test files. Critically, `#include "catch.hpp"` must be present in the file for it to be
compiled into `skunit_tests`. Beyond that, the hierarchy of, `TEST_CASE > SECTION > ASSERTION`
should be followed to improve readability and tracing of errors.

### Testing Changes

If a change is made to the code, the test programs need to be rebuilt. In a WSL terminal enter:

```shell
cd
cd splashkit-core/projects/cmake
make
```

If any files were created or deleted, the CMake files need to be regenerated. In that case use:

```shell
cd
cd splashkit-core/projects/cmake
cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" .
make
```

### Documenting Changes

Local changes can be tested by building and running the test programs. However, once changes are to
be submitted for review, they need to be staged, committed and pushed. It is good practice to
perform multiple smaller commits with meaningful descriptions rather than a single monolithic
commit. In addition, pushing commits to GitHub provides a layer of backup in case of local machine
failure.

### Creating a Pull Request

Once you have completed work on a particular branch, a pull request (PR) can be made. At this point
there are now three relevant splashkit-core repositories at play: splashkit-core itself,
thoth-tech’s fork, and your personal fork. During trimester, PRs should be made against the
thoth-tech fork. The PR template provides a framework for how to structure the associated PR
documentation.

The following guide details how to create PRs for the SplashKit Website. The same instructions can
be used for splashkit-core by simply changing the repository name:
[How to Create a Pull Request](https://thoth-tech.netlify.app/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/03-pull-request).

### Responding to Peer Reviews

If changes are requested during a PR review, pushing further commits to the same branch will
automatically be added to the PR.

### Performing Peer Reviews

A critical component to SplashKit development is the process of reviewing your peers' PRs and
providing constructive feedback. This process has been detailed in the following guide:
[A Guide to Doing Peer Reviews](https://thoth-tech.netlify.app/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/05-peer-review)

### Planner Board

The planner board is used to coordinate tasks while they are being completed and reviewed. The
following guide details the procedure and etiquette which is expected while using the planner board:
[Planner Board Ettiquete](https://thoth-tech.netlify.app/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/07-planner-board)

## Troubleshooting

Solutions for common issues can be found below. Be sure to also check the following page for help
troubleshooting:
[Guide to resolving Common Issues](https://thoth-tech.netlify.app/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/02-troubleshooting)

### Empty Translator folder

If the translator folder is empty, it may be due to an issue with the submodules. In an WSL
terminal, enter the following:

```shell
cd
cd splashkit-core
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
