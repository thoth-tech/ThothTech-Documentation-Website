## Introduction

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- Peer reviews are essential for maintaining high-quality code in SplashKit.
- The Peer-Review Checklist is **required** to be completed for review to ensure consistency across
  the project.
- Peer-Review Prompts are **not mandatory** but serve as a resource to guide discussions. - Prompts
  help foster a collaborative and conversational peer-review process.
  - The goal is to verify code quality and improve together through collaboration.

In SplashKit, peer reviews are an essential part of maintaining high-quality code. The Peer-Review
Checklist provided below is required for every pull request and ensures that all contributions meet
a consistent standard across the project. This checklist covers essential aspects like code quality,
functionality, and testing.

However, we recognize that every feature or task is different, and it’s difficult to capture all
potential review points in a single checklist. That’s why we’ve also included a set of Peer-Review
Prompts. These prompts are not mandatory but serve as a resource to guide the peer-review
discussion. Since peer reviews should always be collaborative, these prompts help ensure that the
review process is conversational and thorough, encouraging reviewers to think critically and explore
areas that may not be immediately obvious.

Remember, the goal of peer reviews is not only to verify the quality of the code but also to foster
a collaborative environment where we improve together.

As a reviewer, it is _your_ responsibility to move the Planner Card to the next column once approval
has been given.

### Splashkit Review Prompts

- **Type of Change**: Does this Pull Request correctly identify the type of change (bug fix, new
  feature, breaking change, or documentation update)? Is it aligned with the stated issue or task?

- **Code Readability**: Is the code structure clean and easy to follow? Could it benefit from
  clearer variable names, additional comments, or better organization? Would this code be
  understandable for a new developer joining the project?

- **Maintainability**: How maintainable is the code? Is it modular and easy to extend in the future?
  Does it avoid creating technical debt? Is the codebase as simple as possible while still
  accomplishing the task?

- **Code Simplicity**: Are there any overly complex or redundant sections in the code? Could they be
  refactored for better simplicity or clarity? Does the code follow established design patterns and
  best practices?

- **Edge Cases**: Does the implementation consider potential edge cases? What could go wrong with
  this code in unusual or unexpected scenarios? Are there any cases that haven’t been fully
  addressed?

- **Test Thoroughness**: Are all key scenarios (including edge cases and failure paths) covered by
  tests? Could additional tests help ensure the reliability of the code? Has the code been tested
  across different environments (e.g., multiple browsers or platforms)?

- **Backward Compatibility**: Does this change break any existing functionality? If so, has backward
  compatibility been handled or documented appropriately? Are there any warnings or notes in the
  documentation regarding compatibility?

- **Performance Considerations**: Could this code have a negative impact on performance? Have any
  performance concerns been documented and tested? Could the code be optimized for better efficiency
  without sacrificing readability?

- **Security Concerns**: Could this change introduce security vulnerabilities, especially in terms
  of input validation or sensitive data handling? Have security best practices been followed? Does
  this code ensure proper user data handling?

- **Dependencies**: Are the new dependencies truly necessary? Could they create conflicts or issues
  down the line, particularly during upgrades or with other libraries in the project? Is there a
  simpler way to achieve the same functionality without adding new dependencies?

- **Documentation**: Is the documentation clear and complete for both internal developers and
  external users? Could a new developer understand how to use or modify this feature from the
  documentation provided? Does it cover any API or external interface changes?
