## Install Necessary Tools

First things first, you'll need to install the necessary tools to get started working within
SplashKit.io.

Head to the [SplashKit.io](https://splashkit.io/) website and follow the instructions for your
specific operating system to install SplashKit.

Then, head to [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and install Docker for your specific
operating system.

Finally, in your code editor of choice, ensure you have added the
[Astro Extension](https://docs.astro.build/en/editor-setup/) to your editor.

### Fork the SplashKit.io Repo

To get started working within the Starlight repo, you need to first head over to GitHub and make
your own fork of the [SplashKit Repo](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit.io-starlight).

### Create Branches for Contributions

To start contributing to the SplashKit.io repo, you'll need to create a new branch for each
contribution. This will keep your changes separate from the main branch. You can create a new branch
in a few different ways:

<Tabs syncKey="github-management">
<TabItem label="Via CLI">
Move into the SplashKit.io directory and create a new branch:

```shell
git checkout -b your-branch-name
```

Then, push the branch to your fork:

```shell
git push origin your-branch-name
```

Now you're all set up to start working on your new branch.
