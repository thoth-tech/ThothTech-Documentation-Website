## How to rebase your branch

<Steps>

1. ### Fetch the Latest Changes from Upstream

   First, fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository to ensure your local copy is
   up-to-date.

   ```shell
   git fetch upstream
   ```

   This command fetches the latest branches and commits from the upstream repository without
   modifying your local working directory.

2. ### Check Out the Branch You Want to Rebase

   Make sure you’re on the branch that you want to rebase. Use the following command to switch to
   your branch:

   ```shell
   git checkout <your-branch-name>
   ```

   Replace `<your-branch-name>` with the name of your branch.

3. ### Rebase Your Branch onto the Latest `main` (or another target branch)

   To rebase your branch onto the latest changes from the upstream `main` branch (or whatever branch
   you want to base your changes on):

   ```shell
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

   This command applies your branch’s commits on top of the latest changes from the upstream `main`
   branch. If you are rebasing onto a different branch (like `development`), replace `main` with the
   appropriate branch name.

4. ### Resolve Conflicts (if necessary)

   If there are any conflicts, Git will pause the rebase process and prompt you to resolve them. To
   see which files are in conflict, run:

   ```shell
   git status
   ```

   Manually resolve conflicts in your files, then add them to the staging area:

   ```shell
   git add <file-name>
   ```

   Once all conflicts are resolved, continue the rebase process:

   ```shell
   git rebase --continue
   ```

   If you want to abort the rebase and return to the state before the rebase began:

   ```shell
   git rebase --abort
   ```

5. ### Push the Rebasing Changes to Your Fork

   Once the rebase is complete, you need to force push the changes to your fork, as the history has
   been rewritten:

   ```shell
   git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

   The `--force-with-lease` option ensures that you don't accidentally overwrite someone else’s
   changes in case they pushed while you were rebasing.

6. ### Verify the Rebasing

   You can now verify that your branch is rebased and up to date with the upstream changes:

   ```shell
   git log
   ```

   This will show the commit history, allowing you to confirm that your commits are on top of the
   latest upstream changes.

   By following these steps, you will have successfully rebased your branch onto the latest `main`
   branch (or whichever branch you're targeting) from the upstream repository.

</Steps>

## How to resolve conflicts during a rebase or merge

---

<Steps>

1. ### Identify Conflicts

   During a rebase or merge, if Git detects conflicts that it cannot resolve automatically, it will
   pause the process and display a message indicating which files have conflicts. You can check the
   status to identify which files are in conflict:

   ```shell
   git status
   ```

   Git will show the files that are in conflict and need your attention. Conflicted files will
   appear under the `both modified` section.

2. ### Open the Conflicted Files

   Open the conflicted files in your preferred text editor (e.g., vscode). In the file, you will see
   conflict markers that look like this:

   ```plaintext
   <<<<<<< HEAD
   // Code from your current branch
   =======
   /* Code from the branch you are rebasing or merging */
   >>>>>>> branch-name
   ```

   - **`HEAD`** contains the changes from your current branch.
   - The **`=======`** separates the two conflicting versions.
   - The text below the `=======` represents changes from the branch you are merging or rebasing
     onto.

3. ### Manually Resolve the Conflicts

   To resolve the conflict, decide whether to keep your changes, the incoming changes, or a
   combination of both.

   - **Keep your changes**: Delete the lines between `=======` and `>>>>>>>` and remove the conflict
     markers.
   - **Keep the incoming changes**: Delete the lines between `<<<<<<< HEAD` and `=======` and remove
     the conflict markers.
   - **Combine both changes**: Modify the conflicting section to include both sets of changes, based
     on your needs, and then remove the conflict markers.

   After resolving the conflicts, the file should look clean and without any conflict markers.

4. ### Mark the Conflicts as Resolved

   Once you have resolved the conflicts in a file, you need to add the file to the staging area to
   let Git know that the conflict has been resolved:

   ```shell
   git add <file-name>
   ```

   Repeat this for all the conflicted files.

5. ### Continue the Rebase or Merge Process

   Once all conflicts are resolved and staged, you can continue the process.

   - If you are in the middle of a **rebase**, continue with:

     ```shell
     git rebase --continue
     ```

   - If you are in the middle of a **merge**, finalize the merge with:

     ```shell
     git merge --continue
     ```

   If at any point you want to abort the rebase or merge due to complications, you can use the
   following command:

   ```shell
   git rebase --abort
   ```

   or

   ```shell
   git merge --abort
   ```

6. ### Push the Resolved Changes

   After resolving the conflicts and completing the rebase or merge, you will need to push the
   changes back to your remote repository. If you performed a rebase, you will need to force-push
   the branch since the commit history has been rewritten:

   ```shell
   git push --force-with-lease origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

   If it was a merge, a normal push will suffice:

   ```shell
   git push origin <your-branch-name>
   ```

7. ### Verify Everything

   After pushing, you can verify that everything is resolved and the history is clean:

   ```shell
   git log
   ```

   This will show the commit history, confirming that your conflicts were successfully resolved.
