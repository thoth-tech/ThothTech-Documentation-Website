## Introduction on how to do a peer review within the SplashKit Web Dev Team

<Aside type="tip" title="TL;DR">

- Peer reviews are essential for maintaining high-quality code in the SplashKit website project.
- The Peer-Review Checklist is **required** for every review to ensure consistency.
- Peer-Review Prompts are **optional** but serve as a resource to guide discussions.
- The goal is to verify code quality while fostering collaboration and improvement.

</Aside>

In SplashKit, peer reviews are a vital process to ensure code quality, maintainability, and
consistency across the website development project. Every pull request (PR) must follow the
Peer-Review Checklist, which checks for key factors like functionality, code readability, and
documentation.

Additionally, the Peer-Review Prompts serve as a conversation starter for reviewers, encouraging
collaboration while allowing for a thorough and constructive review process.

### SplashKit Peer-Review Checklist

The following checklist is required to be completed for every review to ensure high-quality
contributions.

```plaintext
## General Information

- [ ] Type of Change: Clearly indicate the type of change (choose one):
  - [ ] Bug fix
  - [ ] New feature
  - [ ] Breaking change
  - [ ] Documentation update

## Code Quality

- [ ] Repository: Ensure the PR is made to the correct repository.
- [ ] Readability: Is the code easy to read and follow? Are comments included where necessary?
- [ ] Maintainability: Can this code be maintained or extended easily in the future?

## Functionality

- [ ] Correctness: Does the code meet the task requirements?
- [ ] Existing Functionality: Has the impact on existing functionality been considered and tested?

## Testing

- [ ] Test Coverage: Are unit tests provided for new or modified code?
- [ ] Test Results: Have all tests passed successfully?

## Documentation

- [ ] Documentation: Is the inline and external documentation updated and clear?

## Pull Request Details

- [ ] PR Description: Is the problem being solved clearly described?
- [ ] Checklist Completion: Have all relevant checklist items been reviewed and completed?
```

### SplashKit Peer-Review Prompts

These prompts can help guide discussions during the review process and ensure that the code meets
high standards.

- **Type of Change**: Is the PR correctly identifying the type of change (bug fix, new feature,
  etc.)?
- **Code Readability**: Is the code well-structured and easy to follow? Could better comments,
  names, or organisation improve it?
- **Maintainability**: Is the code modular and easy to maintain? Does it introduce any technical
  debt?
- **Code Simplicity**: Are there redundant or overly complex parts of the code that could be
  simplified?
- **Edge Cases**: Does the code account for edge cases? What scenarios might cause it to break?
- **Test Thoroughness**: Does the testing cover all edge cases and failure paths? Are there enough
  tests to ensure code reliability?
- **Backward Compatibility**: Does the change break any existing functionality? If so, is backward
  compatibility handled or documented?
- **Performance Considerations**: Could this code impact performance negatively? Can it be optimised
  while maintaining readability?
- **Security Concerns**: Does this change introduce any security risks? Is input validation handled
  properly?
- **Dependencies**: Are new dependencies necessary? Could they conflict with existing libraries?
  Could this functionality be achieved without new dependencies?
- **Documentation**: Is the documentation clear and thorough enough for new developers to
  understand? Does it cover API or external interface changes?

## Review Guidelines for Specific File Types

Different file types require different levels of attention during the review process. Here's what to
look for when reviewing each type of file:

### `.mdx` Files

- **Content Accuracy**: Ensure that the content is clear and accurate. Double-check for any errors
  in the documentation or guides.
- **Frontmatter**: Ensure the frontmatter (`title`, `description`, etc.) is correctly filled out.
- **Component Usage**: Verify that components such as `LinkCard`, `CardGrid`, or others are being
  used appropriately within the `.mdx` files.

### `.css` Files

- **Consistency**: Check that the styles align with the **Styling Guide** and maintain a consistent
  use of variables (e.g., colours, fonts, spacing).
- **Accessibility**: Review for accessibility considerations, such as whether animations are
  disabled for users who prefer reduced motion, and whether contrast ratios meet **WCAG 2.1 AA**
  standards.
- **Naming Conventions**: Ensure that CSS class names follow a consistent naming pattern.

### `.jsx`/`.tsx` Files

- **Functionality**: Make sure the interactive components (e.g., sliders, forms) work as expected
  and meet the requirements of the task.
- **Performance**: Look for unnecessary re-renders or other performance concerns.
- **Code Style**: Ensure the code follows **React/JSX** best practices and any project-specific
  linting rules.

### `.astro` Files

- **Structure**: Ensure the page or component is well-structured and follows the **Astro standards**
  for component and page creation.
- **Reusability**: Look for opportunities to refactor repetitive code into reusable components.
