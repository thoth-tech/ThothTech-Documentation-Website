## Proper Planner Board Etiquete

The planner board is where all tasks are tracked. You can find tasks to claim and work on, or add
your own tasks that you will complete. Here are some guidelines to ensure smooth teamwork and
efficient use of the planner board.

<Steps>

1. ### Claiming a Task

   - **Commit to work:** Only claim a task if you are ready to work on it.
   - **Unclaim if needed:** If you are unable to proceed with a task you've claimed, unclaim it so
     others can take over.
   - **Update status:** Once you claim a task, move it to the "Doing" column to signal that it's
     being actively worked on.

2. ### Adding a Task

   - **Be clear and concise:** When adding a task, provide a meaningful title and a detailed
     description.
   - **Add checklists:** If the task involves multiple steps, include a checklist to outline them
     clearly.
   - **Use appropriate tags:** Tag the task with relevant labels to categorise it properly, such as
     `Tutorials` if it's tutorial based, or `usage examples` if it's a usage example.

3. ### Moving Tasks

   - **Include relevant links:** When completing a task, attach links to the pull request (PR) and
     any other relevant information.
   - **Add a completion comment:** Leave a comment on the task card with the date you completed the
     task.
   - **Move to Peer Review:** After completing a task, move it to the "First Peer Review" column so
     a team member can review it.

   > guide for detailed instructions.

4. ### First Peer Review

   - **Follow the review process:** Adhere to the steps outlined in the
     [Peer Review Guide](/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/05-peer-review).
   - **Request changes if needed:** Provide feedback and request changes if required.
   - **Approval:** Once the task meets the standards, approve it and the PR, then move the task to
     the "Second Peer Review" column.
   - **Leave a comment:** Add a comment with the date and confirmation that you've approved the
     task.

5. ### Second Peer Review

   - **Follow similar steps:** Conduct the second peer review following the same guidelines as the
     first.
   - **Mentor Review:** After approving the PR, move it to the appropriate "Mentor Review" column.
   - **Comment on approval:** As before, leave a comment with the date and a note indicating you've
     approved the task for mentor review.

6. ### Mentor Review

   - **Final review:** The mentor will review the task and provide feedback.
   - **Request changes:** If changes are needed, the mentor will request them and move the task back
     to the "doing" column.
   - **Approval:** Once the mentor approves the task, they will merge the PR and move the task to
     the "completed" column.
