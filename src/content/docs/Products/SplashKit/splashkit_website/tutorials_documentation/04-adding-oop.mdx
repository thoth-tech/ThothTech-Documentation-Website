## Adding OOP and Top Level C# to Splashkit Tutorials

One of the current goals of the SplashKit team is to enhance the tutorials by including both
top-level statement and object-oriented (OOP) versions of C# programs. This guide outlines how to
effectively integrate OOP into the existing tutorials, providing both options for users to choose
from.

### The Full Code Block Structure

The full code block structure for C++, C# in top level and OOP, and Python is as follows:

````md
<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp

Add C++ code here

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">
<Tabs syncKey="csharp-style">
<TabItem label="Top-level Statements">

```csharp

Add top-level statement version of C# code here

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Object-Oriented">

```csharp

Add OOP version of C# code here

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Python">

```python

Add Python code here

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

This is the new standard structure for all Splashkit tutorials. The C# code block has been replaced
with a tabs component that contains two tabs, one for top-level statements and one for
object-oriented programming. The C# code block has been replaced with a tabs component that contains
two tabs, one for top-level statements and one for object-oriented programming.

### Adding OOP to the Splashkit tutorials

If you are adding OOP to the Splashkit tutorials, you will need to replace the C# section with the
following code block in order to have both top-level statements and object-oriented programming
options:

````md
<Tabs syncKey="csharp-style">
<TabItem label="Top-level Statements">

```csharp

Add top-level statement version of C# code here

```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Object-Oriented">

```csharp

Add OOP version of C# code here

```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

## Example

Once done, the view of the code blocks will remain the same on the Splashkit site. However, once
clicking on the C# tab, the user will be able to see both the top-level statements and
object-oriented programming versions of the code.

<Tabs syncKey="code-language">
<TabItem label="C++">

```cpp
#include "splashkit.h"

int main()
{
    string name;  // declare a variable to store the name
    string quest; // and another to store a quest

    write("What is your name: "); // prompt the user for input
    name = read_line();           // read user input

    // read in another value
    write("And what is your quest? ");
    quest = read_line();

    write_line(name + "'s quest is: " + quest); // output quest to the terminal

    return 0;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="C#">

<Tabs syncKey="csharp-style">
<TabItem label="Top-level Statements">

```csharp
using static SplashKitSDK.SplashKit;

string name;    // declare a variable to store the name
string quest;   // and another to store a quest

// Read in another value
Write("And what is your quest? ");
quest = ReadLine();

WriteLine(name + "'s quest is: " + quest); // output quest to the terminal

            // Read in another value
            SplashKit.Write("And what is your quest? ");
            quest = SplashKit.ReadLine();

            SplashKit.WriteLine(name + "'s quest is: " + quest); // output quest to the terminal
