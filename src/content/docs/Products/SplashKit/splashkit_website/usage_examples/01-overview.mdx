### What are Usage Examples?

Usage examples demonstrate a specific Splashkit function within a simple, small program. The goal is
to keep the program minimal while clearly showing how the function works.

For instance, the `write_line` example on the Splashkit site found
[here](https://splashkit.io/usage-examples/terminal/#hello-world-string) shows how the `write_line`
function works, with a brief explanation, program code, and a screenshot of the output.

The following pages cover all the steps to create, submit, and review usage examples for the
Splashkit website.

## Steps to Completing a Usage Example

<Steps>

1. **Choose a Planner Card or Idea**:  
   Pick an existing planner card that matches a SplashKit function, or create a unique example. Make
   sure the idea clearly demonstrates the function in a practical or visually interesting way.

2. **Develop a Demonstrative Program**:  
   Write a simple program to illustrate the function’s use. Focus on clarity and simplicity,
   ensuring that the code is easy to follow and that it showcases the function effectively.

3. **Write the Program in Multiple Languages**:

   - **C++**: Implement the example with standard C++ practices.
   - **C#**: Provide both a version using top-level statements and an Object-Oriented (OOP) version.
   - **Python**: Write a Python version that is straightforward and reflects the same functionality.

4. **Capture Output Screenshots and Write Explanations**:  
   Run each program version, take screenshots of the output, and write a brief explanation for each
   language version. Describe what the program does, which function it demonstrates, and highlight
   any important details.

5. **Add Files to the Correct Folder in the SplashKit Repository**:  
   Organize your files in the appropriate folders within the SplashKit repository. Ensure file names
   and directory paths are consistent with SplashKit’s structure.

6. **Submit a Pull Request for Usage Examples**:  
   Follow the steps in the
   [Pull Requests for Usage Examples guide](/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/usage-examples/03-usage-pull-request).
   Use the provided PR template, describe your example clearly, and attach explanations and
   screenshots to the pull request.
