## Preparing to do a Pull Request

Before starting the pull request ensure you have followed the steps in the
[Usage Example Overview](/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/usage-examples/01-overview) guide for
creating a usage example. Ensure you have the files listed below added, with their names updated to
the function you are demonstrating.

```plaintext
write_line-1-hello-world.cpp
write_line-1-hello-world.py
write_line-1-hello-world-top-level.cs
write_line-1-hello-world-oop.cs
write_line-1-hello-world.png or .gif
write_line-1-hello-world.txt
```

## Creating a Pull Request

Usage examples have their own process when it comes to doing pull requests. You'll follow the same
steps on the [pull request guide](/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/03-pull-request),
however, the destination branch needs to be changed to be **usage-example-contributions**.

Then remove the default template in the pull request, and instead use the following template:

```shell
# Overview
Describe the example and what it demonstrates.

Splashkit Function: `function_name`

# Files Included
- [ ] Title and explanation (.txt)
- [ ] C++ code
- [ ] C# code (top-level statements)
- [ ] C# code (Object-Oriented Programming)
- [ ] Python code
- [ ] Screenshot

# Usage Example Checks
- [ ] Simple, clear demonstration of the function
- [ ] Code uses Splashkit functions
- [ ] Tested in Chrome and Firefox
```

Once submitted, move the associated planner card to peer review and link the pull request. Follow
the [Planner Board Etiquette](/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/07-planner-board) for
more details on the process.
