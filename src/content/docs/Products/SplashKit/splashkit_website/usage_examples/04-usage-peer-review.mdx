## Peer Reviewing a Usage Example

Doing a peer review for usage examples follows the same process as the
[peer review guide](/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/05-peer-review). However, you
will need to follow the steps for reviewing usage examples.

When reviewing an example, follow these steps:

1. Test each code file on your machine.
2. Check the structure and functionality of the code in each language.
3. Review the preview on the website.

If there are any issues comment on the pull request with the necessary changes. Once those changes
are made, then use the following template as your comment in the pull request.

```shell
# Peer Review

I've reviewed the ...

# Checks
- [ ] All required files are present.
  - [ ] Title and explanation (.txt)
  - [ ] C++ code
  - [ ] C# code (top-level statements)
  - [ ] C# code (Object-Oriented Programming)
  - [ ] Python code
- [ ] Code correctly uses Splashkit functions.
- [ ] Code clearly demonstrates the function.
- [ ] All versions maintain the same structure and comments.

# Tests done
- [ ] C++ code ran correctly.
- [ ] C# top level code ran correctly.
- [ ] C# OOP code ran correctly.
- [ ] Python code ran correctly.
```

Ensure while doing peer reviews that you also follow the
[Planner Board Etiquette](/products/splashkit/splashkit-website/onboarding/07-planner-board) for
moving tasks through the process.
