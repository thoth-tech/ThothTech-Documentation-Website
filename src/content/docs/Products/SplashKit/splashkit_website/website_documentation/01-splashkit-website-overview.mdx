## **Welcome to the SplashKit Website Development Team!**

## Introduction

The SplashKit website is the gateway to empowering learners and developers with the tools they need
as they begin their journey in programming and game development. Having a well-designed, accessible,
and user-friendly website is important for new learners, as it ensures that resources, tutorials,
and documentation are easily accessible to everyone, regardless of their level of experience or any
accessibility challenges they may face.

As a team, we’re focused on creating a site that reflects the inclusivity and innovation of the
SplashKit SDK, making sure everyone can get the most out of what we offer.
