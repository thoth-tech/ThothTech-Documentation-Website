## Key Files to Update

### `package.json` and `package-lock.json`

- **Purpose**: `package.json` defines the project’s dependencies, metadata, and scripts, while
  `package-lock.json` locks the versions of the dependencies to ensure consistency across different
  environments.

- **Installing Dependencies**:  
  When you run `npm install <xyz>`, the new package is added to the `package.json` under the
  `dependencies` or `devDependencies` section. It also updates `package-lock.json` to lock the
  specific versions of the installed dependencies.

  **Example**:

  ```shell
  npm install react
  ```

  This will add `react` to `package.json` under dependencies:

  ```json
  {
    "dependencies": {
      "react": "^17.0.2"
    }
  }
  ```

  It will also update `package-lock.json` to include detailed version information for `react` and
  any transitive dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.

In most cases, you won’t need to manually edit `package.json` or `package-lock.json`. If you want to
remove a dependency, it’s best to use:

```shell
npm uninstall <package_name>
```

This will automatically remove the package from both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. By
doing this, the project stays clean and free of unused dependencies.

### `astro.config.mjs`

**Purpose**: This config file defines the core settings for the Astro project, such as integrations,
site metadata, and base URLs.

**Updates**: You may need to modify this file when adding integrations (e.g., Google Analytics) or
updating site-wide settings such as title, description, or site configuration. Below are some
specific examples:

#### Site Metadata

- **Why Update?**: You may want to change the global title, description, or other metadata for
  search engine optimisation and branding purposes.
- **Example**:

  ```js
  export default {
    site: "https://example.com",
    base: "/",
    markdownOptions: {
      rehypePlugins: [],
    },
    build: {
      format: "directory",
    },
  };
  ```

  Update `site` or `base` when the site’s URL changes or if you want to modify markdown handling
  (affecting headings, tables, etc.).

#### Integrations

- **Why Update?**: If you’re adding design frameworks like TailwindCSS or optimising images through
  Astro.
- **Example**: Integrating TailwindCSS for utility-first styling.

  ```js
  import tailwind from "@astrojs/tailwind";

  export default {
    integrations: [tailwind()],
  };
  ```

  This allows you to quickly apply Tailwind's design utilities across your project.

#### Customising Vite

- **Why Update?**: When you need to customise the build pipeline to handle assets (images, fonts)
  more efficiently.
- **Example**: Adjust Vite settings to optimise or transform images.

  ```js
  export default {
    vite: {
      build: {
        assetsInlineLimit: 4096, // in bytes
      },
    },
  };
  ```

  This controls when assets are inlined versus being loaded separately, which impacts performance
  and design choices.

#### Page Transitions and Animations

- **Why Update?**: If you're adding smooth page transitions or animations between pages to improve
  UX.
- **Example**: Adding an integration for animations using Astro Motion.

  ```js
  import motion from "astro-motion";

  export default {
    integrations: [motion()],
  };
  ```

  This adds visual flair and smoother transitions between pages.

#### Enabling SCSS or PostCSS

- **Why Update?**: If you need to support SCSS for custom styling workflows.
- **Example**: Enabling SCSS in Astro.

  ```js
  import { sass } from "@astrojs/sass";

  export default {
    integrations: [sass()],
  };
  ```

  This allows you to use SCSS for modular and efficient styling.

## Core Development Files

### `.astro` Files

- **Purpose**: `.astro` files define the structure of pages and components. They are commonly used
  for building both static and dynamic website content.

- **What to update**: Add or modify pages in `src/pages/` or components in `src/components/`.

- **Scenario**: You need to update the sidebar to include a new section in the website's navigation.

- **How to update**: Modify the existing `Sidebar.astro` component to add a new navigation link
  pointing to the new section.

  ```astro
  <aside>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/home">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/about">About Us</a></li>
        <li><a href="/new-section">New Section</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </aside>
  ```

- **Explanation**: In this example, a new `<li>` element with the link to `/new-section` is added to
  the sidebar's navigation, allowing users to navigate to the newly created page.
- **When to update**: Edit `.astro` files when changing page layouts, adding components, or
  modifying the site’s structure. \*/}

---

### `.jsx` and `.tsx` Files

- **Purpose**: Handles interactivity and dynamic content through React components.

- **What to update**: If adding or editing interactive elements like carousels, forms, or sliders,
  modify these files. They’re typically located in `src/components/react/`.

---

### `.css` Files

- **Purpose**: CSS files manage the website's styles, such as layout, typography, colour palettes,
  and spacing. Common styles are defined in files like `src/styles/custom.css`, which holds the
  custom styles for the website.

- **What to update**: You can modify styles in files like `custom.css` or create new
  component-specific styles depending on the changes being made to the design or layout.

#### Example 1: Adjusting the colour palette in `custom.css`

- **Scenario**: You need to update the website’s colour scheme to match a new brand identity.
- **How to update**: Modify CSS variables in `custom.css` to reflect the new colours.

  ```css
  :root {
    --primary-colour: #3498db;
    --secondary-colour: #2ecc71;
    --accent-colour: #e74c3c;
    --background-colour: #f4f4f4;
  }
  ```

#### Example 2: Adding custom styles for a specific component

- **Scenario**: You want to add specific styles for a newly created `Button.astro` component.
- **How to update**: Add styles to `custom.css` for the `button` class or ID specific to the
  component.

  ```css
  .button-primary {
    background-colour: var(--primary-colour);
    colour: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    border: none;
    cursor: pointer;
  }
  ```

- **When to update**: Modify CSS files when making changes to the overall design (e.g., colour
  palette, typography) or when specific components need unique styles.

## Image and Asset Management

### Asset Directories

- **Purpose**: The asset directories store static files such as images, gifs, and config files.
  Proper organisation ensures that assets are easy to find and use in the project.

- **Directory Structure**:

  - **GIFs**: Store all general-purpose gifs in `public/gifs/`, regardless of content. However, if
    the gif is used as part of a usage example (such as in a tutorial or documentation), store it in
    `public/usage-examples-images-gifs/`.
  - **Config Files**: Any configuration files that are generated from scripts (e.g.,
    `games-config.json`) should be placed directly in the `public/` folder. This ensures they are
    accessible for any part of the project that needs them.

  - **Static Images**: Other static assets, such as images associated with tutorials, should be
    stored in the same folder as the corresponding `.mdx` file. This keeps the related assets
    organised with the content they belong to.

- **Example**:

  - A gif demonstrating a tutorial should be placed in `public/usage-examples-images-gifs/`.
  - An image used in a physics tutorial stored in `src/content/docs/guides/physics/images` should
    sit alongside the tutorial file in that same folder.

---

## `.mdx` Files

- **Purpose**: Markdown files with embedded components for creating content pages.

- **What to update**:
  - Add new content in `src/content/docs/`.
  - Ensure correct frontmatter is used (`title`, `description`, `category`).

---

## Peer Reviews: What to Look For

When performing peer reviews, here’s what you should check for in various files:

### `.mdx` Files

- **Content Accuracy**: Ensure the information is correct and well-organised.
- **Frontmatter**: Check that the frontmatter is complete (e.g., `title`, `description`).
- **Component Usage**: Ensure embedded components are used properly (e.g., `LinkCard` or
  `CardGrid`).

### `.css` Files

- **Consistency**: Ensure that styles follow the project’s styling conventions (e.g., consistent use
  of variables for colours, fonts, and spacing).
- **Naming Conventions**: Ensure class names follow a consistent naming pattern.

### `.jsx`/`.tsx` Files

- **Functionality**: Ensure that the component works as expected.
- **Performance**: Look for unnecessary re-renders or inefficiencies in React component updates.
- **Code Style**: Ensure it follows SplashKit's linting rules.

### `.astro` Files

- **Structure**: Ensure the page/component is well-structured and follows best practices.
- **Reusability**: Consider whether code could be refactored into reusable components.
