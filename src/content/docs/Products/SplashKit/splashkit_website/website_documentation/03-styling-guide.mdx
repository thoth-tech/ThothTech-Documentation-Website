## Colour Palette

- **Primary Colours**: SplashKit uses a consistent colour palette to maintain a clean, cohesive
  design. You are encouraged to use accessible, high-contrast colours that support both branding and
  readability.

### Tools for Colour Palette Generation

- **Coolors.co**: Use [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/) to generate and experiment with colour
  palettes. This platform supports multiple colour spaces and includes contrast checkers, ensuring
  your colour selections meet accessibility standards.

  **Example**:

  ```css
  :root {
    --primary-colour: ;
    --secondary-colour: ;
    --accent-colour: ;
    --background-colour: ;
  }
  ```

- Adjust these values according to the design requirements, ensuring they meet accessibility
  standards like **WCAG 2.1 AA**.

## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is a key concern, and we need to ensure that our design is inclusive and easy to
navigate for all users, including those with visual impairments.

### 1. **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**

- When designing for accessibility, ensure that colour contrast meets the **Web Content
  Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA** standards. These include:
  - A contrast ratio of at least **4.5:1** between text and background for normal text.
  - A contrast ratio of at least **3:1** for larger text (18pt and above).
- Use tools like the **Color Theme Editor**, **Coolors.co contrast checker**, and the **Pilestone
  Color Blindness Simulator** to verify your designs are accessible for all users.

### 2. **Disabling Animations and Smooth Transitions**

- Users should have the option to disable animations and transitions to avoid distracting or
  overwhelming effects.

  **CSS Example**:

  ```css
  @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    * {
      animation: none !important;
      transition: none !important;
    }
  }
  ```

  To learn more about this feature, visit the
  [@media (prefers-reduced-motion) documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-reduced-motion).

### 3. **Hover Effects and Visual Cues**

- Ensure that elements that change on hover, such as buttons or links, are clearly identifiable as
  interactive elements. A subtle colour change on hover is a good way to indicate that the element
  is clickable.

  **Example**:

  ```css
  a {
    color: var(--primary-colour);
  }

  a:hover {
    color: var(--accent-colour);
  }
  ```

### 4. **Colour Blindness Accessibility**

- Use tools like the
  [Pilestone Color Blindness Simulator](https://pilestone.com/pages/color-blindness-simulator-1) to
  test how different users experience colours. This tool is particularly useful for ensuring that
  users with various forms of colour blindness can comfortably navigate the site.

  Ensure that contrast ratios are sufficient to make text legible for all users, particularly those
  with colour vision deficiencies.

## Typography

### Font

Use a modern, readable font to maintain consistency across the website.

- Default fonts like `Arial`, `Roboto`, or `Gaegu` can be used for headers and body text.
- Follow the existing import patterns for fonts:

  ```css
  @import url("https://use.typekit.net/vzr3ole.css");
  @import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Gaegu&display=swap");
  ```

### Font Sizes

- Headings: Use larger font sizes for hierarchy and structure.
- Body text: Minimum 16px for readability.
- Example:

  ```css
  h1 {
    font-size: 2.5rem;
    font-weight: bold;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 1rem;
  }
  ```

If needed, you can adjust these values in `custom.css` to fit specific design elements.

---

## Component Styling

### Buttons

Buttons should use consistent styles across the website to ensure a cohesive look.

- **Primary Button**: **Example**:

  ```css
  .button-primary {
    background-colour: var(--primary-colour);
    colour: white;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    border: none;
  }

  .button-primary:hover {
    background-colour: var(--accent-colour);
  }
  ```

If you're contributing, please review the existing styles in `custom.css` for similar elements and
ensure your additions follow the same structure.

---

## Image and Asset Management

- **GIFs**: General-purpose gifs should be stored in `public/gifs/`. If a gif is used in a usage
  example (tutorials, documentation), store it in `public/usage-examples-images-gifs/`.
- **Static Images**: Images associated with tutorials or content should be stored alongside the
  `.mdx` files they relate to.
- **Config Files**: Any configuration files generated from scripts (e.g., `games-config.json`)
  should be placed in the `public/` folder for easy access.

---

## Color Theme Editor

The
[Starlight Color Theme Editor](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/css-and-tailwind/#:~:text=items%20in%20navigation.-,Color%20theme%20editor,-Use%20the%20sliders)
is an excellent tool for previewing and adjusting colour values for various design elements across
the website. It allows you to tweak background, text, and accent colours in real-time, providing
instant feedback on how those changes will affect the overall design.

### How to Use

- Use the sliders in the editor to adjust different colour variables, which are immediately
  reflected in the preview.
- Once you're satisfied with your selections, you can copy the colour values and apply them to the
  `custom.css` or directly into your `.astro` components.
- This tool is particularly helpful when used in conjunction with **Coolors.co** for creating
  palettes or the **Pilestone Color Blindness Simulator** to ensure accessibility.

## Current Styling Values

Here are the current values being used in the `custom.css` file for the SplashKit website:

```css
@import url("https://use.typekit.net/vzr3ole.css");
@import url("https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css");
@import url("https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Gaegu&display=swap");

/* Dark mode colours. */
:root {
  --purple-hsl: 255, 60%, 60%;
  --overlay-blurple: hsla(var(--purple-hsl), 0.2);
}

/* Light mode colours. */
:root[data-theme="light"] {
  --purple-hsl: 255, 85%, 65%;
  --sl-hue-accent: 350;
  --sl-color-accent: #3d50f5;
}
```

Please review these values when making any changes to ensure consistency.

## Useful Tools

- **Coolors.co**: Use this platform to experiment with colour palettes and ensure your choices are
  accessible.
- **Pilestone Color Blindness Simulator**: Test colour choices for accessibility to users with
  colour vision deficiencies.
- **WCAG 2.1 AA Standards**: Use these standards as the baseline to ensure that the site is
  accessible to all users, particularly with respect to contrast ratios between text and background.
