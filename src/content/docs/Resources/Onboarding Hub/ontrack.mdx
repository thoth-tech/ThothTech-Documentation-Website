## Contributing to OnTrack

Contributing to OnTrack is a great way to enhance a student-focused learning and feedback platform
while gaining experience in development workflows. Whether you’re interested in adding new features,
fixing bugs, improving documentation, or optimizing user experience, we welcome all contributions!

### Trimester Workflow

<ol class="steps">

1. **Explore OnTrack**: Begin by exploring the various OnTrack resources on this website. See below
   for links. Familiarize yourself with the structure and functionality of each project and its
   repositories and contribution guides.
2. **Choose Tasks**: Work with the team or your mentor to identify tasks you can complete. These may
   range from feature development and bug fixes to documentation improvements.
3. **Fork the Repository**: When contributing, be sure to fork from the Thoth-Tech repo. This
   ensures changes are first reviewed and integrated internally before being merged into the main
   project.
4. **Follow the Contribution Guide**: If a repository has its own contribution guide, usually in a
   CONTRIBUTING.md file, then this guide should be followed. These will provide specific guidelines
   to set up environments to work on particular projects. If you are unsure, reach out to fellow
   team members and your mentor for further guidance.
5. **Make Changes**: Begin working on your chosen task. Be sure to follow the repository's
   guidelines and document your work clearly.
6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Use the provided PR template (if available) to submit your work.
   Clearly explain your changes, and explain the context and reasoning behind your changes. Ensure
   your code is well-tested and documented.
7. **Peer Review**: All contributions are subject to peer review. This is an opportunity to
   collaborate with other developers, improve the quality of your code, and ensure that it adheres
   to project standards. Peer reviews will involve a list of tasks that you are expected to review,
   but they are also expected to be in the form of a discussion which aims to produce the best
   changes possible.
8. **Mentor Review**: After peer review, your mentor will review the changes for final approval
   before they are merged.
9. **Merging**: Contributions are typically merged into the main project repository at the end of a
   development trimester, ensuring stability and quality.
