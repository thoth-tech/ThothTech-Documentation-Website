## Contributing to SplashKit

Contributing to SplashKit is a great way to help improve a powerful, beginner-friendly game
development toolkit while gaining experience in open-source development. Whether youâ€™re interested
in adding new features, fixing bugs, improving documentation, or helping with testing, we welcome
all kinds of contributions!

### Trimester Workflow

<Steps>

1. **Explore SplashKit**: Begin by exploring the various SplashKit resources on this website. See
   below for links. Familiarize yourself with the structure and functionality of each project and
   its repositories and contribution guides.
2. **Choose Tasks**: Work with the team or your mentor to identify tasks you can complete. These may
   range from feature development and bug fixes to documentation improvements.
3. **Fork the Repository**: When contributing, be sure to fork from the Thoth-Tech repo, not the
   upstream SplashKit repo. This ensures changes are first reviewed and integrated internally before
   being merged upstream.
4. **Follow the Contribution Guide**: If a repository has its own contribution guide, usually in a
   CONTRIBUTING.md file, then this guide should be followed. These will provide specific guidelines
   to setup environments to work on particular projects. If you are unsure, reach out to fellow team
   members and your mentor for further guidance.
5. **Make Changes**: Begin working on your chosen task. Be sure to follow the repository's
   guidelines and document your work clearly.
6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**: Use the provided PR template (if available) to submit your work.
   Clearly explain your changes, and explain the context and reasoning behind your changes. Ensure
   your code is well-tested and documented.
7. **Peer Review**: All contributions are subject to peer review. This is an opportunity to
   collaborate with other developers, improve the quality of your code, and ensure that it adheres
   to project standards. Peer reviews will involve a list of tasks that you are expected to review,
   but they are also expected to be in the form of a discussion which aims to produce the best
   changes possible.
8. **Mentor Review**: After peer review, your mentor will review the changes for final approval
   before they are merged.
9. **Merging**: Contributions are typically merged upstream at the end of a development trimester,
   ensuring the stability and quality of the SplashKit project.
