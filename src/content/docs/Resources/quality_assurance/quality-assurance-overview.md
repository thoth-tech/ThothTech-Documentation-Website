## [Why/What is Quality Assurance?](#whywhat-is-quality-assurance)

Quality Assurance (QA) is a procedure designed to ensure the quality of software products or
services delivered by an organisation. It focuses on enhancing the software development process to
meet the defined quality standards effectively.

## [Software Development and Testing](#software-development-and-testing)

The [Testing and Development Processes Document](/resources/quality-assurance/testing-and-dev)

development process.
