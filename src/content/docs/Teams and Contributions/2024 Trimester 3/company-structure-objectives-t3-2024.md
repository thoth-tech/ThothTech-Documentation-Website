## Project 2 - SplashKit

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

SplashKit is a versatile and user-friendly programming framework designed to introduce students to
programming through the engaging process of 2D game development. Primarily coded in C++, SplashKit
also supports a variety of other languages, including C#, Python, Pascal, and, more recently,
JavaScript.

The SplashKit Software Development Kit (SDK) offers seamless integration with popular development
environments, enabling the easy incorporation of robust graphics and game development capabilities
into projects. With a single codebase, developers can create games and applications that run across
multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. The SplashKit SDK is renowned for its
intuitive interface and a comprehensive set of features that streamline the game development
process.

Additionally, SplashKit provides an extensive array of detailed documentation and tutorials,
designed to help students get started quickly and maximise their use of the SDK. This wealth of
resources empowers learners to progress at their own pace and fully explore the capabilities of
SplashKit, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners and more advanced users.

SplashKit will be running with the following projects during T3 2024:

#### **SplashKit Website & Tutorials**

Powered by the Starlight framework, the revamped SplashKit website aims to offer an enriched and
user-friendly experience for developers and learners. The SplashKit Website will also feature
tutorials aimed at helping students learn and explore SplashKit’s functionality. The focus is on
developing smaller, high-quality tutorials across C++, C#, and Python, rather than extensive series.

#### **SplashKit Expansion**

The Expansion team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the SplashKit core. This includes
bug fixes, feature improvements, and refining installation and usage workflows through package
creation and addressing installation issues.

#### **SplashKit Online**

SplashKit Online is developing a web-based IDE that allows students to write and run code directly
in their browsers. Initially launched as a prototype in 2023, the 2024 goal is to mature this tool
into a comprehensive product, including C# support and an embeddable version for the SplashKit
website.

_SplashKit also has two other main lines of effort, however these will not be running in T3 2024:_

#### **Arcade Machines**

The university has acquired four arcade machines equipped with Raspberry Pi 3B+ units, designed to
showcase games developed with SplashKit. The short-term goal is to prepare these platforms for
students to display their SplashKit creations. The medium-term goal is to streamline the process for
first-year students to easily upload and test their games.

#### **Game Development**

The Game Development team is dedicated to creating and enhancing games that run on the arcade
machines. Their mission is to demonstrate SplashKit’s capabilities and inspire students by
showcasing what can be achieved with the framework.

### Aims for Trimester

Trimester Aims for SplashKit Development:

#### **Strengthen Communication and Coordination Across Teams**

This trimester, a key objective is to strengthen communication and coordination across teams by
implementing regular cross-team updates. The plan is to establish a way to better share the status
of each project during regular meetings. This system will provide better visibility into each team’s
progress, streamline task allocation, and significantly reduce duplicated work. Improved
communication will also allow teams to work in sync, especially as they develop and contribute to
new features like the embedded lite version of SplashKit Online.

#### **Enhance and Consolidate Project Documentation**

Another primary goal is to enhance and consolidate project documentation by centralising all
resources in a single, accessible location. This will involve restructuring and clearly labelling
documentation so every team member can quickly locate necessary materials and contribute
efficiently. As part of this aim, a structured upskilling pathway will be implemented, helping new
contributors build skills early on through usage examples, with a gradual path towards contributing
to tutorials.

#### **Migrate, Embed, and Automate Package Management for SplashKit Online**

For SplashKit Online, the priority is to migrate it to the Thoth Tech repository, centralising its
management and integrating it more effectively with the broader SplashKit project. As part of this
aim, a “lite” version will be embedded directly into the SplashKit website, showcasing code snippets
and usage examples to help new users engage with the framework in an accessible, hands-on way.
Additionally, an automated package management system will streamline deployment and version
tracking, making it easy for users to install, update, and maintain SplashKit across different
platforms.

#### **Refine and Expand Tutorial Content to Cover Advanced Topics and Language Support**

Expanding the tutorial content to cover advanced topics is another significant goal. This includes
creating tutorials for game mechanics and network-based functionalities. Additionally, a continued
focus on refining existing tutorials will ensure support across C++, C#, and Python, making content
user-friendly and intuitive. By introducing these languages and topics through structured usage
examples, contributors will develop familiarity with SplashKit gradually, ultimately supporting more
sophisticated development skills by the trimester’s end.

#### **Develop a Comprehensive Testing Framework for SplashKit**

To ensure high software quality, a robust testing framework will be developed for SplashKit,
supporting stable functionality across its language targets. This trimester’s goal is to complete
the test suite for one language target, establishing a foundation for further testing in C++, C#,
and Python. This will ensure that both new and existing tutorials and features perform reliably,
supporting the growth of a well-tested, professional development environment for SplashKit users.

#### **Revamp Project Management Features on SplashKit Online**

Finally, there will be a revamp of project management on SplashKit Online, enhancing features for
project creation, version control, and exporting. By implementing executable exporting, version
tracking, and potential collaborative features, SplashKit Online will become a more versatile and
powerful tool for project management. These upgrades, combined with the embedded lite version, will
allow users to work more effectively within the platform and engage interactively, furthering
SplashKit’s capabilities as a comprehensive online IDE.
