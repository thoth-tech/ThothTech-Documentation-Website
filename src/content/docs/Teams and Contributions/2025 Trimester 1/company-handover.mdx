#### AppAttack x OnTrack

We successfully initiated a collaboration with the HardHat AppAttack team to conduct a two-phase
security testing process for OnTrack.

- _Stage 1_ vulnerability scanning was completed, and initial findings were received on _7 April
  2025_.

- A complete workflow was designed to manage the vulnerability mitigation process, which included:
  1. Establishing scope and agreement with AppAttack,
  2. Categorizing vulnerabilities based on severity,
  3. Recruiting a dedicated patching team,
  4. Creating and assigning tickets in Microsoft Teams Planner,
  5. Prioritizing and addressing critical vulnerabilities first.

- The team implemented fixes for multiple high-impact vulnerabilities, including:

  | Vulnerability Name                                                   | Impact Level |
  | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
  | Clickjacking                                                         | Severe       |
  | Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)                              | Major        |
  | Malicious Code Execution                                             | Major        |
  | Exposed JavaScript Source Maps _(False Positive)_                    | Major        |
  | Session Hijacking and Fixation                                       | Significant  |
  | Token Exposure via Local Storage and HTTP Headers _(False Positive)_ | Significant  |
  | Misconfigured CORS _(False Positive)_                                | Significant  |

- Fixes for Clickjacking and IDOR vulnerabilities were completed and pull requests were raised to
  the upstream feature branch, with Clickjacking successfully merged.

- Although the full retesting cycle is pending, the team initiated internal validation of key fixes
  based on the documentation provided by AppAttack. This ensured timely feedback loops and quality
  assurance in the absence of immediate external retesting.

- The final End-of-Trimester security report from AppAttack is expected to be shared to support
  future OnTrack development cycles and to maintain ongoing platform security improvements.

#### SSRF Testing on OnTrack

- Developed a _Bash-based automated script_ for SSRF payload injection across API endpoints.
- Performed multiple rounds of testing and logged potential vulnerabilities.
- Worked on enhancing the script for _scalability and integration with Burp Suite_.
- Collaborated with the patching team to address vulnerabilities discovered by the AppAttack phase.

#### Bug Fixes & Urgent Enhancements

- Issues with the student calendar and notifications has been resolved and pull requests have been
  submitted.
- Issues with building the app on Windows has been identified and a fix has been deployed into the
  upstream 8.0.x branch.

#### New Feature Additions

#### Staff Extension Management

- Planner board tickets for the Staff Grant Extension feature have been created, outlining frontend
  and backend responsibilities in detail.
- Backend development was completed for importing and exporting tutorial data using CSV format.
- A new modal interface was implemented, allowing staff to enter extension durations and select
  multiple students simultaneously.
- The backend now successfully grants extensions based on staff input, ensuring seamless interaction
  between UI and data layer.
- A new in-system notification system was developed from scratch, allowing students to receive
  updates related to granted extensions directly within OnTrack.
- Email notifications were also integrated, ensuring students are notified through multiple
  channels.
- Initial UI wireframes and user flows were completed and used as the foundation for the final
  implementation.

#### Gauge Chart

- Replaced the legacy progress burndown chart with an interactive **ngx-charts-based gauge chart**
  to provide a cleaner visual representation of student progress.
- Dynamically displays key progress metrics including **Target**, **Projected**, **To Submit**, and
  **To Complete** using distinct color bands and percentage values in the form of a Gauge
- Center value auto-updates based on the **Marked** percentage.
- Interactive legend: Clicking on a legend item (e.g., "Marked") isolates that segment on the gauge,
  temporarily hiding all others for focused viewing.

#### Student Self-Enrollment into Projects

- An implementation plan has been proposed and has been adjusted accordingly to meet the project
  requirements. Progress has begun on the UI.

#### Student Self-Enrollment into Projects

- An implementation plan has been proposed and has been adjusted accordingly to meet the project
  requirements. Progress has begun on the UI.

#### Tutor Times Module

- Progress has begun both on the front-end and back-end, but has temporarily been put on pause due
  to outdated documentation of the feature that has lead to different understandings of the goal of
  the feature.

#### Staff Extension Management

- Planner board tickets for the Staff Grant Extension feature have been created, outlining frontend
  and backend responsibilities in detail.
- Backend development has been finalized for the CSV import/export of tutorial data.
- Frontend work for the same functionality is underway, with integration currently in progress.
- UI wireframes and user flow for the extension management interface have been completed, forming
  the foundation for frontend implementation.

### Roadmap

#### AppAttack x OnTrack

Although the team successfully addressed 7 of the initially reported vulnerabilities, 3 critical
issues remain unresolved due to time constraints in the current trimester:

- Publicly Accessible API Documentation via Swagger
- Privilege Escalation – Tutor Accessing Admin Pages
- Insufficient Token Entropy
- These issues have been logged for future action and will be passed on to the incoming development
  cohort.
- The AppAttack x OnTrack initiative is designed as a cyclical vulnerability resolution process,
  where ongoing findings from HardHat will be reviewed, prioritised, and patched incrementally by
  future teams.
- End of Trimester Security Report with new vulnerabilities have been received for future cohorts to
  work upon.
- Patch plans are available in the security board to ensure smooth continuity.

#### Onboarding Guide for New OnTrack Contributors

An onboarding guide is planned to support new students joining the OnTrack project in future
trimesters. This guide will be published in the OnTrack technical documentation (doubtfire-astro)
and will include:

- Environment setup instructions (Node, Docker, Git access),
- Navigating the Planner board and understanding task structure,
- Contribution process (feature branches, PR creation, peer reviews),
- Common setup errors and FAQs. This task is currently not started and will be prioritized in the
  next trimester to streamline onboarding and reduce dependency on live mentorship.

#### Bug Fixes & Urgent Enhancements

Bug resolution and urgent frontend/backend enhancements are ongoing processes tracked in dedicated
Planner buckets and will be continued by future teams as part of regular maintenance.

#### Planned Improvements

Ongoing improvements such as UI redesigns, grade tracking features, model migrations, and structural
standardization are in the pipeline and recommended for future development cycles.

#### Panopto Video Integration

Integration with Panopto for secure video uploads, metadata handling, and embedding is fully scoped
but remains in backlog for future implementation across frontend and backend components.

#### OnTrack Documentation Website

Efforts to centralize OnTrack’s technical documentation and create a dedicated onboarding experience
remain in backlog, with plans to unify API and backend docs in upcoming trimesters.

#### Multiple Organisations Support

Planned enhancements to support multi-organisation functionality-including switching logic, access
control, and org-based context switching-remain in backlog for future implementation.

#### Incorporate Content in OnTrack

A new feature to enable content integration within OnTrack-including API updates, frontend component
builds, and database schema changes is fully scoped but remains in backlog.

#### Tutor Times Feature

A full-stack Tutor Times feature-spanning frontend integration, session tracking services, analytics
APIs, and documentation has been fully scoped but remains in backlog for future development.

#### Staff Grant Extension

While the feature is functionally complete, remaining backlog items such as performance testing and
error handling are pending and may be addressed in future sprints if required.

#### Authentication Module

The authentication module including third-party sign-ons, secure cookie handling, and internal
password management is in backlog and scoped for future implementation.

#### Security Enhancement

Pending security tasks including CI/CD testing integration, access control fixes, audit issue
resolutions, and standardizing authentication—are in backlog for future implementation and
hardening.

#### CourseFlow Feature

CourseFlow aims to introduce interactive components for displaying unit details, credit points, and
course requirements currently scoped and in backlog for future frontend development.

#### Frontend Migration: AngularJS & CoffeeScript → Angular & TypeScript

Migration of legacy AngularJS and CoffeeScript components to Angular 17 and TypeScript is underway,
with several modules completed and others still in progress and under review.

### Open Issues

- The purpose of this section is to flag things that may interfere with the future team's ability to
  work on the project, and to give advice as to how these issues could be fixed in the future.
- Despite steady progress across technical deliverables, the OnTrack team has encountered several
  persistent issues that may impact continuity and learning outcomes for future cohorts:

#### Skills Gap & Onboarding Challenges

Many students join OnTrack with the intent to learn and contribute meaningfully. However, the steep
learning curve particularly around complex technologies like Angular, TypeScript, and legacy
CoffeeScript has made it difficult for newcomers to get started. Without structured technical
onboarding, many spend the first 3–4 weeks simply trying to understand the system, which delays
their ability to contribute effectively.

#### Development Environment & Compatibility Issues

Setting up the local development environment remains a significant hurdle, especially for peers
using lower spec Windows machines. Docker image sizes are large, and the performance gap compared to
Mac users creates an uneven learning experience. Compatibility differences between branches (e.g.,
`8.0.x` vs `9.x`) also lead to frequent build issues, creating confusion and discouraging ongoing
contributions.

#### Lack of Training & Documentation Support

While OnTrack encourages open contributions, many team members struggle due to limited training in
core concepts (e.g., Git workflows, Angular framework, Typescript, and Docker). There is an implicit
expectation that students are already proficient, which often isn’t the case this leads to
frustration and reduced engagement. Structured training sessions and technical documentation
tailored for beginners would significantly improve project onboarding.

#### Fragmented Review and Contribution Workflow

The process for reviewing Planner board tasks, GitHub pull requests, and migration progress lacks
consistency. Without clear ownership and review pathways, some completed work sits idle or gets
delayed due to unclear approval hierarchies.

#### Recommendations for Future Teams

- Introduce a **structured onboarding program** covering setup, Git, and core stack training.
- Create a **beginner-friendly setup guide** tailored for Windows environments.
- Regularly audit compatibility across OnTrack branches and Docker images.
- Communicate with **mentors** or **sub-leads** to guide and unblock newcomers.
- Encourage documentation of common issues and fixes directly within the repo.
- Leverage the resources listed in the **[User Manual](#user-manual)** section, which includes:
  - [T1 2025 Setup Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sg4A6UgFGbmmWJza8y8QjRzm2w64bVQx/view)

### Lessons Learned

- Throughout the trimester, the OnTrack team gained valuable insights into effective collaboration,
  workflow management, and the importance of technical readiness. The following lessons are shared
  to help future teams avoid common pitfalls and adopt practices that support sustained progress and
  learning.

#### Mentorship and Leadership Engagement

- Mentors played a pivotal role in guiding the team, clarifying complex tasks, and helping
  contributors stay aligned with deadlines. However, low attendance in mentor meetings created
  knowledge gaps for some students, leading to missed updates and slower progress. Future cohorts
  should prioritize regular mentor engagement to stay informed and unblock technical or
  process-related issues early.

#### Planner Board Usage and Task Management

- A common challenge observed was the inconsistent use of the Planner board. Tasks were often left
  unupdated, causing confusion around team progress and responsibility. Familiarity with Planner
  usage, card ownership, and regular updates is essential for maintaining transparency,
  accountability, and momentum in collaborative work.

#### GitHub Fluency and Frontend Migration

- A significant number of contributors struggled with frontend migration tasks due to limited
  experience with GitHub and version control best practices. This impacted review cycles and slowed
  down feature delivery. It is highly recommended that new team members undergo early Git and GitHub
  training, particularly around pull requests, branching strategies, and commit hygiene.

#### Continuous Learning and Skill Development

- Capstone projects like OnTrack require more than just effort they demand continuous upskilling.
  Many students realized mid-trimester that improving their understanding of technologies like
  Angular, TypeScript, and Docker was essential to contribute effectively. Future teams should
  proactively allocate time for learning, especially when entering unfamiliar technical domains.

#### Time Management and Self-Discipline

- Delayed deliverables and unfinished tasks were often linked to weak time management. Without
  consistent planning and regular progress tracking, students found it difficult to meet sprint
  goals. Future cohorts should adopt strategies like weekly planning, setting personal deadlines,
  and using reminders to stay on track and contribute reliably.

#### Final Advice

- New teams may assume that deep technical knowledge is required before contributing. However, what
  truly matters is consistency, communication, and a willingness to learn. Investing time early to
  understand the workflow, connect with mentors, and get comfortable with the tools will yield
  strong contributions by the end of the trimester.

### Product Development Life Cycle

We continue to use Agile methodologies to deliver updates and new features for OnTrack. Our approach
includes 2-week sprints focused on completing tasks, and weekly stand-up meetings to assess
progress, share updates, discuss roadblocks, and assign new tasks via Teams Planner cards.

#### New Tasks

- New tasks are assigned by the project mentor during the weekly stand-up meetings. Once you
  areassigned a task, be sure to assign yourself to the corresponding Teams Planner card and attach
  your draft or completed pull request when you begin work.
- If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, schedule a meeting with the project mentor
  to discuss it. Upon approval, create a new card or backlog column in Teams Planner to track the
  task.
- If the feature is large, start researching the benefits and challenges, and create a Spike
  document, which can be committed to the documentation repository.
- Spike templates are available in the documentation repository.

#### Definition of Done

A task is considered complete once it has been fully tested, functions as expected, and is
documented in a well-organized pull request. The task must also undergo peer review and be approved
by your mentor. Ensure that the corresponding Teams Planner card is updated and keep in
communication with your reviewer and mentor until your contribution is merged into the upstream
`doubtfire-lms` repository.

#### Task Review

- Each pull request requires a mandatory peer review before a mentor review. After creating the pull
  request, contact a teammate to review it. Tag them as the reviewer in both the Teams Planner card
  and the GitHub pull request.
- As a reviewer, ensure that you test the code by pulling the changes locally and reviewing the
  syntax, logic, and output. If any changes are needed, update the contribution and notify the
  reviewer.
- Once the updates are made, the pull request will be automatically updated.
- After the peer review is complete, notify the mentor for their review. Once approved, you can
  submit the pull request to the upstream repository for the final review.

#### Testing

- For frontend changes, test the functionality in the browser or run specification tests as needed.
- For backend changes, use browser interactions or tools like Postman to test functionality.
- Additionally, GitHub CI Actions will run tests automatically when changes are pushed.
- In the pull request template, include detailed instructions on how others can test your changes.
- Always provide before-and-after screenshots to show the outcome of your modifications.

#### Branching Strategy

- When starting a new contribution, fork all three `thoth-tech` repositories (`deploy`, `web`, and
  `API`) to your GitHub profile.
- Create a new branch from the development branch of the relevant repository. For example, for
  frontend migrations, you would create a branch from the `doubtfire-web` development branch.\
- Follow the **Branch Prefixes and Commit Message Format** in the Contributing Guide when naming
  branches and creating commits.

### Product Architecture

OnTrack is developed as a collaborative open-source project built on top of the Doubtfire-LMS
ecosystem. It comprises four key components:

- **Doubtfire-Web**: The frontend application responsible for user interface and interactions. Built
  using Angular.
- **Doubtfire-API**: The backend service that handles business logic and communicates with the
  database. Built using Ruby on Rails.
- **Database**: A structured relational database (e.g., MariaDB) that stores all persistent
  application data.
- **Doubtfire-Deploy**: Infrastructure scripts and configuration used to deploy OnTrack in a stable
  and maintainable environment, primarily using Docker and associated CI/CD tools.

OnTrack is maintained and enhanced by **ThothTech**, a student-led capstone development team at
Deakin University. The project is **forked from the official Doubtfire-LMS repository**, which is
managed by Company Directors and Mentors. The LMS environment represents the **production-grade
implementation**, while ThothTech serves as the innovation space where new features, patches, and
improvements are developed, tested, and refined before potential upstream contribution.

#### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Currently being migrated from AngularJS and CoffeeScript to Angular 17 and
  TypeScript. The stack also includes HTML, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS.

- **Backend**: Built on Ruby on Rails with the Grape Framework. It uses MariaDB as the database
  engine. Docker is used for deployment and local development.

## Project 2: SplashKit

### Project Overview

SplashKit is an open-source software development framework designed to simplify game and application
developement for beginners and students. It was primarily coded in C++ but has since offer supports
for addition languages such as C#, Python, Pascal, and JavaScript.

SplashKit provides users with a set of pre-built libraries for graphics, sound, input handlindg and
more, making it easier to create interactive applications. It also offers an extensive documentation
and tutorials designed to help students get started quickly and maximise their use of the SDK. This
wealth of resources empowers learners to progress at their own pace and fully explore the
capabilities of SplashKit, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners and more advanced users.

SplashKit ran with the following projects during T1 2025:

#### **SplashKit Website & Tutorials**

Powered by the Starlight framework, the revamped SplashKit website aims to offer an enriched and
user-friendly experience for developers and learners. The SplashKit Website will also feature
tutorials aimed at helping students learn and explore SplashKit’s functionality. The focus is on
developing smaller, high-quality tutorials across C++, C#, and Python, rather than extensive series.

#### **SplashKit Expansion**

The Expansion team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the SplashKit core. This includes
bug fixes, feature improvements, units testing, and refining installation and usage workflows
through package creation and addressing installation issues.

#### **SplashKit Online**

SplashKit Online is developing a web-based IDE that allows students to write and run code directly
in their browsers. Initially launched as a prototype in 2023, the 2025 goal is to mature this tool
into a comprehensive product, including further C# support and refining the embedded version for the
SplashKit website.

#### **Arcade Machines**

The university has acquired four arcade machines equipped with Raspberry Pi 3B+ units, designed to
showcase games developed with SplashKit. The short-term goal is to prepare these platforms for
students to display their SplashKit creations. The medium-term goal is to streamline the process for
first-year students to easily upload and test their games.

### Open Issues

#### Onboarding Process and Information

Although the Onboarding documentation has been updated to streamline the process and provide clear
guidance, there will still challenges during the onboarding phase. There will difficulties with
setting up developement environments or understanding the workflow process. Through help hub
sessions and mentorship, we were to somewhat address concerns but this issues suggest that while the
documentation is a good foundation, it may benefit from further refinement. This could be adding
step-by-step tutorials or a more structured onboarding checklist.

#### Task Review Process

While the requirement of each task to go through two peer reviews followed by a mentor review helps
ensure quality and maintain high coding standards, it has also led to a significant bottleneck in
the workflow. As the volume of tasks increase, the number of reviewers often falls short, causing
many completed task to remain in a pending state for extended period. This delay can hinder overall
progress and reduce team momentum. Without a more scalable review process or improved review
scheduling, the current approach may continue to strain the efficiency of the team.

#### Lack of Communication between Groups

While regular stand-ups meetings with overlapping members from different sub-products exist, there
is still a noticable lack of a collaborative efforts across teams. As a result, oppportunities for
synergy between products are missed where shared challenged could arise across teams and allow for
chances to reduce duplication in problem resolution. Moving forward, the company should consider
creating more opportunities for collaboration with cross-functional discussions, shared planning
sessions, or joint tasks could help bridge this gap and promote a stronger sense of team across the
entire ecosystem.

### Lessons Learned

#### The Importance of Collaboration

This trimester offered a clear reminder of how essential effective is to the success of a project.
While individual contributions are important, greater progress happens when team works together,
share ideas or knowledge, and support one another. Instances where collaboration sparked often led
to faster problem-solving, innovative ideas, and higher-quality outcomes. Moving forward, creating a
more connected and communicative team culture is key to reaching the true potential of the company.

#### Further Onboarding Refinements

Despite improvements to the onboarding documentation, this trimester revealed areas that still need
to be addressed. Some members found the setup process confusing, ran into build issues, or lacked
clarity on where to start. This highlights the need for more structured onboarding, potentially with
interactive guides, videos, or more designated support for new members.

#### Balancing Contributions and Reviews

As the trimester progressed, it became clear that balancing the rate of new contributions with
capacity of peer reviews is essential for maintaining the project's momentum and efficiency. While
students were increasingly productive in terms of pull requests, the review process often lagged
behind, creating a backlog of tasks needing feedback. Building a stronger culture and emphasis
around reviewing, dedicated review times, or review responsibilities assignment could lead to a
better balance between contribtutions and reviews, allowing for a more efficient development cycle.

### Product Development Life Cycle

#### New Task

In SplashKit, we place a strong emphasis on reponsiblity and accountablity; this means individuals
are encouraged to ownership and self-assign tasks/cards to themselves. Members are free to assign
themselves to any card unless noted otherwise. To ensure clarity and alignment with project's goals,
the process of creating a new task are listed below:

- **Problem or Opportunity Idenfication**: If you notice any areas of improvement or come across an
  idea for new features, discuss it with a mentor. This can be done via stand-ups/team meetings or
  direct one-on-one communication with the mentor.
- **Approval**: Upon discussion, the mentor will evaluate the relevance and feasibility of the task
  brough up and if approved, this card should be made in Planner to outline its scope and
  requirements.
- **Assignment**: After the card is created, you can assign yourself to it but you must ensure that
  the tasks's objectives are fully understood before work begins.
- **Collaboration (if necessary)**: For larger or complex tasks, it can be coordinated with other
  members to determine if the task needs collaboration to complete.

#### Definition of Done

A task is only considered fully done once it has been completed, submitted as a pull request, and
reviewed by two other students who approve it (see below). Once a mentor reviews it, it may be
considered fully complete or potentially moved back to “doing” if deemed unsatisfactory.

#### Task Review

Two mandatory peer reviews must be completed before the mentor reivew. Once a pull request is
created:

1. **Contact a Reviewer**: You can either reach out a teammate for review or forward your pull
   request to the team channel. Upon agreement, tag them under the Teams Planner card and GitHub
   pull request as the reviewer.
2. **Reviewer Responsibilities**: Review the code by:
   - Checking syntax, logic, and output.
   - Pulling the changes onto your local machine to test functionality.
3. **Feedback Process**: If the reviewer requests changes:
   - Update the contribution based on the feedback.
   - Notify the reviewer once changes are committed and pushed. This will automatically update the
     pull request, eliminating the need to create a new one.
4. **Completion of Peer Reviews**: Once two peer reviews are completed and the contribution is
   deemed correct, the pull request can be moved to the "Mentor Review" column.

for a step-by-step guide on creating and reviewing pull requests.

Once the pull request is in the “Mentor Review” column, a mentor will review the work. If
satisfactory, it will be marked as complete and moved to the current sprint’s “Complete” column. If
additional changes are needed, the task may be moved back to “Doing” for further refinement.

### Product Architecture

The SplashKit ecosystem is a comprehensive set of tools and platforms that streamline game
development and support learning for both beginnners and experienced developers. The architecture
consists of interconnected components, each with a specific purpose, working together to deliver a
smooth and integrated experience:

#### SplashKit SDK (Core Foundation)

At the core of the SplashKit ecosystem is the SplashKit SDK, a powerful toolkit built with **C++**,
**SDL**, and **OpenGL**. It provides essential game development featues such as graphics rendering,
input handling, and audio support. Through automated translation into languages like **C#**,
**Python**, and **Pascal**, the SDK broadens its accessibility across various programming
communities.

- Integration: The SDK powers all games developed within the ecosystem, supports tools like
  SplashKit Online, and forms the basis of the games showcased on the SplashKit.io website.

#### SplashKit.io Website (User Portal)

The SplashKit website acts as the primary interface for developers with access to the **API
documentation**, **Installation Guides**, and **Tutorials**. It was built using **Astro Starlight**,
**React**, **SolidJS**, and **TailwindCSS** to ensure responsive user-friendly experience.
Integration using Dockerised deployment with **NodeJS** ensures scalability and consistency.

- Interaction: The website saw integration with SplashKit Online, allowing for interactive examples
  and development tools. It also showcases functions' examples along with games developed using
  SplashKit with a recently added feature where users can test out the game online.

#### SplashKit Online (Interactive Development)

SplashKit Online extends the capabilities of the SDK with a web-based **IDE** that allows for
real-time coding and testing without the need for local installations. It's powered by **WebAssembly
(WASM)** and **Emscripten**, the platform currently supports coding with **C++** and **JavaScript**.

- Role in Ecosystem: This component is an exciting and innovative tool that can used during
  onboarding new developers, especially for beginners, allowing them to experiment with SplashKit
  without any setup.

#### Arcade Machine (Hardware Integration)

Developed in collaboration with Deakin University, the arcade machines run on Raspberry Pi hardware,
leveraging emulationstation and retropie. These machines allow developers to test and showcase their
games in a real-world arcade environment, offering a tactile experience that bridges software and
hardware.

- Interaction: Games created using the SplashKit SDK can be directly uploaded and tested on these
  machines, demonstrating the SDK’s versatility.
