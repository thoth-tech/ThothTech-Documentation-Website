## Project 2 - SplashKit

### Project Overview

SplashKit is an open-source software development framework designed to simplify game and application
developement for beginners and students. It was primarily coded in C++ but has since offer supports
for addition languages such as C#, Python, Pascal, and JavaScript.

SplashKit provides users with a set of pre-built libraries for graphics, sound, input handlindg and
more, making it easier to create interactive applications. It also offers an extensive documentation
and tutorials designed to help students get started quickly and maximise their use of the SDK. This
wealth of resources empowers learners to progress at their own pace and fully explore the
capabilities of SplashKit, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners and more advanced users.

SplashKit will be running with the following projects during T1 2025:

#### **SplashKit Website & Tutorials**

Powered by the Starlight framework, the revamped SplashKit website aims to offer an enriched and
user-friendly experience for developers and learners. The SplashKit Website will also feature
tutorials aimed at helping students learn and explore SplashKit’s functionality. The focus is on
developing smaller, high-quality tutorials across C++, C#, and Python, rather than extensive series.

#### **SplashKit Expansion**

The Expansion team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the SplashKit core. This includes
bug fixes, feature improvements, units testing, and refining installation and usage workflows
through package creation and addressing installation issues.

#### **SplashKit Online**

SplashKit Online is developing a web-based IDE that allows students to write and run code directly
in their browsers. Initially launched as a prototype in 2023, the 2025 goal is to mature this tool
into a comprehensive product, including further C# support and refining the embedded version for the
SplashKit website.

#### **Arcade Machines**

The university has acquired four arcade machines equipped with Raspberry Pi 3B+ units, designed to
showcase games developed with SplashKit. The short-term goal is to prepare these platforms for
students to display their SplashKit creations. The medium-term goal is to streamline the process for
first-year students to easily upload and test their games.

#### Game Development

- **Establish Standardised Implementation Patterns**:

  - Enforce the decoupling of data/functionality and state/render patterns to improve modularity and
    maintainability.
  - Develop and document a prescribed implementation pattern to ensure consistency and quality
    across all projects.

- **Develop a "10 Minute Game"**:

  - Collaboratively plan and execute the development of a simple game (e.g., idle game, tower
    defence, or survivor.io-like).
  - Prioritise implementing core game mechanics in the first sprint to establish a functional
    baseline.
  - Dedicate the latter half of the trimester to improving visual representation, adding "juice,"
    and creating variations of core game elements (e.g., enemies, powerups, weapons).
  - This approach ensures core functionality is completed within a single trimester, while
    additional features are developed using a standardised interface that integrates seamlessly with
    the core game types.

- **Iterate on Prescribed Patterns**:

  - Adjust and refine the implementation pattern based on student feedback and practical
    experiences.

- **Generate Development Artifacts**:

  - Create comprehensive documentation on the implementation of discrete game systems, including:
    - Terrain generation systems (e.g., IDW, random walk, noise-based techniques).
    - 2D light marching.
    - Threaded state update and render patterns.

- **Improve Documentation**:

  - Address the lack of adequate documentation for existing games to significantly reduce onboarding
    time for new contributors.
  - For completed games, create:

### Open Issues

#### Onboarding Process and Information

Although the Onboarding documentation has been updated to streamline the process and provide clear
guidance, there will still challenges during the onboarding phase. There will difficulties with
setting up developement environments or understanding the workflow process. Through help hub
sessions and mentorship, we were to somewhat address concerns but this issues suggest that while the
documentation is a good foundation, it may benefit from further refinement. This could be adding
step-by-step tutorials or a more structured onboarding checklist.

#### Task Review Process

While the requirement of each task to go through two peer reviews followed by a mentor review helps
ensure quality and maintain high coding standards, it has also led to a significant bottleneck in
the workflow. As the volume of tasks increase, the number of reviewers often falls short, causing
many completed task to remain in a pending state for extended period. This delay can hinder overall
progress and reduce team momentum. Without a more scalable review process or improved review
scheduling, the current approach may continue to strain the efficiency of the team.

#### Lack of Communication between Groups

While regular stand-ups meetings with overlapping members from different sub-products exist, there
is still a noticable lack of a collaborative efforts across teams. As a result, oppportunities for
synergy between products are missed where shared challenged could arise across teams and allow for
chances to reduce duplication in problem resolution. Moving forward, the company should consider
creating more opportunities for collaboration with cross-functional discussions, shared planning
sessions, or joint tasks could help bridge this gap and promote a stronger sense of team across the
entire ecosystem.

### Lessons Learned

#### The Importance of Collaboration

This trimester offered a clear reminder of how essential effective is to the success of a project.
While individual contributions are important, greater progress happens when team works together,
share ideas or knowledge, and support one another. Instances where collaboration sparked often led
to faster problem-solving, innovative ideas, and higher-quality outcomes. Moving forward, creating a
more connected and communicative team culture is key to reaching the true potential of the company.

#### Further Onboarding Refinements

Despite improvements to the onboarding documentation, this trimester revealed areas that still need
to be addressed. Some members found the setup process confusing, ran into build issues, or lacked
clarity on where to start. This highlights the need for more structured onboarding, potentially with
interactive guides, videos, or more designated support for new members.

#### Balancing Contributions and Reviews

As the trimester progressed, it became clear that balancing the rate of new contributions with
capacity of peer reviews is essential for maintaining the project's momentum and efficiency. While
students were increasingly productive in terms of pull requests, the review process often lagged
behind, creating a backlog of tasks needing feedback. Building a stronger culture and emphasis
around reviewing, dedicated review times, or review responsibilities assignment could lead to a
better balance between contribtutions and reviews, allowing for a more efficient development cycle.

### Product Developement Life Cycle

#### New Task

In SplashKit, we place a strong emphasis on reponsiblity and accountablity; this means individuals
are encouraged to ownership and self-assign tasks/cards to themselves. Members are free to assign
themselves to any card unless noted otherwise. To ensure clarity and alignment with project's goals,
the process of creating a new task are listed below:

- **Problem or Opportunity Idenfication**: If you notice any areas of improvement or come across an
  idea for new features, discuss it with a mentor. This can be done via stand-ups/team meetings or
  direct one-on-one communication with the mentor.
- **Approval**: Upon discussion, the mentor will evaluate the relevance and feasibility of the task
  brough up and if approved, this card should be made in Planner to outline its scope and
  requirements.
- **Assignment**: After the card is created, you can assign yourself to it but you must ensure that
  the tasks's objectives are fully understood before work begins.
- **Collaboration (if necessary)**: For larger or complex tasks, it can be coordinated with other
  members to determine if the task needs collaboration to complete.

#### Definition of Done

A task is only considered fully done once it has been completed, submitted as a pull request, and
reviewed by two other students who approve it (see below). Once a mentor reviews it, it may be
considered fully complete or potentially moved back to “doing” if deemed unsatisfactory.

#### Task Review

Two mandatory peer reviews must be completed before the mentor reivew. Once a pull request is
created:

1. **Contact a Reviewer**: You can either reach out a teammate for review or forward your pull
   request to the team channel. Upon agreement, tag them under the Teams Planner card and GitHub
   pull request as the reviewer.
2. **Reviewer Responsibilities**: Review the code by:
   - Checking syntax, logic, and output.
   - Pulling the changes onto your local machine to test functionality.
3. **Feedback Process**: If the reviewer requests changes:
   - Update the contribution based on the feedback.
   - Notify the reviewer once changes are committed and pushed. This will automatically update the
     pull request, eliminating the need to create a new one.
4. **Completion of Peer Reviews**: Once two peer reviews are completed and the contribution is
   deemed correct, the pull request can be moved to the "Mentor Review" column.

for a step-by-step guide on creating and reviewing pull requests.

Once the pull request is in the “Mentor Review” column, a mentor will review the work. If
satisfactory, it will be marked as complete and moved to the current sprint’s “Complete” column. If
additional changes are needed, the task may be moved back to “Doing” for further refinement.

  SplashKit Online, and forms the basis of the games showcased on the SplashKit.io website.

#### SplashKit.io Website (User Portal)

The SplashKit website acts as the primary interface for developers with access to the **API
documentation**, **Installation Guides**, and **Tutorials**. It was built using **Astro Starlight**,
**React**, **SolidJS**, and **TailwindCSS** to ensure responsive user-friendly experience.
Integration using Dockerised deployment with **NodeJS** ensures scalability and consistency.

- Interaction: The website saw integration with SplashKit Online, allowing for interactive examples
  and development tools. It also showcases functions' examples along with games developed using
  SplashKit with a recently added feature where users can test out the game online.

#### SplashKit Online (Interactive Development)

SplashKit Online extends the capabilities of the SDK with a web-based **IDE** that allows for
real-time coding and testing without the need for local installations. It's powered by **WebAssembly
(WASM)** and **Emscripten**, the platform currently supports coding with **C++** and **JavaScript**.

- Role in Ecosystem: This component is an exciting and innovative tool that can used during
  onboarding new developers, especially for beginners, allowing them to experiment with SplashKit
  without any setup.

#### Arcade Machine (Hardware Integration)

Developed in collaboration with Deakin University, the arcade machines run on Raspberry Pi hardware,
leveraging emulationstation and retropie. These machines allow developers to test and showcase their
games in a real-world arcade environment, offering a tactile experience that bridges software and
hardware.

- Interaction: Games created using the SplashKit SDK can be directly uploaded and tested on these
  machines, demonstrating the SDK’s versatility.

#### Game Development (Content Showcase)

The Game Development team produces games that highlight the capabilities of the SplashKit SDK. These
games, typically developed in **C++** or **C#**, showcase advanced features like dynamic graphics,
audio handling, and AI systems, serving as inspiration and learning tools for new developers.
