## Project 2 - SplashKit

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

SplashKit is an open-source software development framework designed to simplify game and application
developement for beginners and students. It was primarily coded in C++ but has since offer supports
for addition languages such as C#, Python, Pascal, and JavaScript.

SplashKit provides users with a set of pre-built libraries for graphics, sound, input handlindg and
more, making it easier to create interactive applications. It also offers an extensive documentation
and tutorials designed to help students get started quickly and maximise their use of the SDK. This
wealth of resources empowers learners to progress at their own pace and fully explore the
capabilities of SplashKit, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners and more advanced users.

SplashKit will be running with the following projects during T1 2025:

#### **SplashKit Website & Tutorials**

Powered by the Starlight framework, the revamped SplashKit website aims to offer an enriched and
user-friendly experience for developers and learners. The SplashKit Website will also feature
tutorials aimed at helping students learn and explore SplashKit’s functionality. The focus is on
developing smaller, high-quality tutorials across C++, C#, and Python, rather than extensive series.

#### **SplashKit Expansion**

The Expansion team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the SplashKit core. This includes
bug fixes, feature improvements, units testing, and refining installation and usage workflows
through package creation and addressing installation issues.

#### **SplashKit Online**

SplashKit Online is developing a web-based IDE that allows students to write and run code directly
in their browsers. Initially launched as a prototype in 2023, the 2025 goal is to mature this tool
into a comprehensive product, including further C# support and refining the embedded version for the
SplashKit website.

#### **Arcade Machines**

The university has acquired four arcade machines equipped with Raspberry Pi 3B+ units, designed to
showcase games developed with SplashKit. The short-term goal is to prepare these platforms for
students to display their SplashKit creations. The medium-term goal is to streamline the process for
first-year students to easily upload and test their games.

### Aims for Trimester

Trimester Aims for SplashKit Development:

#### **Expand Project Management Features on SplashKit Online**

For SplashKit Online, a key objective is to add tools for creating, saving, laoding, and managing
multiple projects with version control. Additionally, version control integration will be
implemented to improve project tracking, collaboration, and organization.

#### **Improvement of Communication and Coordination between Teams**

This trimester, we aim to enhance communication and coordination between teams by establishing
clearer workflows, improving cross-team collaboration, and streamlining project management
processes. Our focus will be on implementing structured communication channels, ensuring that
development, testing, and documentation teams are aligned and working efficiently. We will continue
regular stand up meetings, feedback loops, and collaborative tools to facilitate seamless
information sharing and faster issue resolution.

#### **Develop and Refine Unit Tests for SplashKit**

To ensure high software quality, we will be looking at developing an array for unit tests for
SplashKit as well as looking into inconsistencies with previous unit tests made to ensure we achieve
the desired outcome and maintain industry standards.

#### **Improve Project Documentation**

A key objective this trimester is to enhance project documentation by ensuring all information is
up-to-date and aligned with the current workflow. This will involve regularly reviewing, updating,
and organizing documentation to improve clarity, accessibility, and usability for all team members.

#### **Expansion of the SplashKit Website Usage Examples and Beyond SplashKit**

The SplashKit Website team will be attempting to go through the backlogs of Usage Examples to
further enhance the user experience on the site while also creating more resources for Beyond
SplashKit, offering users the opportunity to learn how to code these functions without SplashKit.
