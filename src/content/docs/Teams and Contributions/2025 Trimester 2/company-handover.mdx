## Project 1 - OnTrack

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

OnTrack, also known as Doubtfire, is an innovative Learning Management System (LMS) designed
specifically for skill-based course delivery. This platform enhances the connection between tutors
and students, with a primary focus on Deakin University and other global educational institutions.
OnTrack aims to elevate the educational experience by offering a structured, efficient, and
interactive learning environment. The system is crafted to improve student engagement, boost
learning outcomes, and streamline the teaching and learning process, benefiting both students and
educators.

The OnTrack team is dedicated to continuously improving the platform by working on all planned
deliverables each trimester. While the team strives to complete all objectives, any remaining
deliverables are carried forward, encouraging the next generation of leaders to take ownership and
drive the project forward. This approach ensures the long-term sustainability and evolution of
OnTrack, fostering a culture of responsibility, innovation, and continuous enhancement for the
benefit of future users.

Additionally, our team aims to maintain the quality of our work and improve the usability of
OnTrack. This includes fixing bugs, improving workflows, and making the platform more accessible for
all users. For example, we worked on adding color themes to support students with color blindness,
reducing barriers for those users. We also prioritize documentation and transparency. By keeping
clear records of what’s done, what’s in progress, and what’s next, we make sure new teams can pick
up where we left off without guessing. We understand that documentation saves time, prevents
repeated mistakes, and helps the project grow faster.

Other key goals include:

- Responding to feedback – We have a strict peer review process that allows us to learn from each
  other.

- Promoting sustainability – By writing clean, maintainable code and clear handover notes, we keep
  OnTrack stable and ready for future development.

Our objective is simple: leave OnTrack better than we found it and make the next team’s start
easier.

_Student Enrollment UI_

- The student enrollment UI has been designed to provide a seamless experience for students
  enrolling in tutorials. It includes intuitive forms and real-time validation to enhance usability.

_Testing and Validation_

- Comprehensive testing has been conducted to ensure the reliability and functionality of the
  self-enrollment feature, including unit tests, integration tests, and user acceptance testing.

#### 7. Staff Grant Extension

The staff grant extension feature has progressed significantly this trimester. A dedicated page has
been developed to enable staff to grant extensions, and the necessary backend API endpoints are now
in place.

Next steps include finalizing the routing for the Staff Grant Extension (SGE) page, integrating the
backend and frontend components, and ensuring that notification systems—both in-system and
email—function reliably for all extension requests.

Key achievements this trimester include:

- Completed the back-end and front-end integration.
- Completed notification system to send alerts to both students and tutors once extension has been
  granted. (Email and in system)

#### 8. Courseflow

The Courseflow project has progressed quite far this trimester. The ability to mark units as
complete and a skills summary feature have been successfully implemented, providing clearer progress
tracking for students.

The features that have been implemented and reviewed in for CourseFlow this trimester involves:

**Frontend (doubtfire-web)**

- Refactored CourseFlow's front-end code base: maintainability and follow better architectural
  patterns for Angular components.
- Enhanced the search functionality: enhancement to CourseFlow unit search including autocomplete of
  available units that dynamically updates as input updates.
- Added the ability to mark unit as complete: Implemented functionality allowing users to mark units
  as completed, and unit cannot be modified once completed.
- Created an overlay component to display full details regarding a unit.
- Added more metadata to the unit card: Enhanced unit cards with additional information such as
  credit points and level.
- Created a component to display credit points achieved: Built a dedicated component to show
  accumulated credit points, helping users track their progress toward requirements.
- Added options to overload units to a teaching period: Implemented functionality to allow
  scheduling units beyond normal capacity limits for specific teaching periods.
- Added warning logic for unit requirements: Created validation and warning systems to alert users
  when unit selections conflict with prerequisites or requirement rules.

**Backend (doubtfire-api)**

- Created a rake script to create test data for CourseFlow, including course, course map, course map
  units, and their relationships for development and testing.
- Update unit model to host more details (including credit_points, prerequisites, corequisites).
  This trimester, two innovative proposals have been introduced to further enhance OnTrack:

#### 9. OnTrack Documentation Website

Documentation efforts are progressed well this trimester. The team focused on consolidating and
fixing inconsistencies across the OnTrack documentation, ensuring a unified and comprehensive
resource for users. Key achievements include:

- Created documentation for 8.0.x and 9.x branch setup issues.
- Created Powershell script to pull tasks from planner board.
- Created Feature/validate filename.
- Resolved Main Branch Build Errors.
- Created Various migration and feature documentation pull requests.
- Updated todo and migrated list frontend migration guide.
- Added documentation setup guide for the project.
- Added timestamp and author to documentation pages.

#### 10. New Feature Explorations

- A performance benchmarking initiative using Google Lighthouse, proposed by Mostafa Nouri, aims to
  systematically evaluate and improve the platform’s speed, accessibility, and overall user
  experience.
- A gamification strategy for the OnTrack UI, proposed by Joseph Kalayathankal Saji, is designed to
  boost user engagement through interactive and motivational elements.

Both proposals have been currently developed and integrated into the Doubtfire-Astro repository,
with ongoing expansion and refinement. These initiatives reflect the team’s commitment to continuous
improvement and innovation.

### Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the strategic priorities for the next trimester, building on the progress made
in T2 2025. Key areas of focus include completing the frontend migration, implementing new features,
and addressing critical security evaluations.

---

#### 1. Continued Frontend Migration to Angular 17

The migration from AngularJS and CoffeeScript remains a top priority. While significant progress was
made in T2, the work is ongoing.

- **Priority**: Complete the full migration of all legacy components to Angular 17 and TypeScript.
- **Action**: Focus on migrating parent components whose child components have already been updated.
- **Goal**: Achieve improved UI consistency, accessibility, and performance across the entire
  platform.

---

#### 2. Security Enhancements and Penetration Testing

Key vulnerabilities were patched in T2, but the formal penetration testing was delayed.

- **Priority**: Conduct the rescheduled penetration test to thoroughly evaluate all security
  measures.
- **Action**: Address any new findings from the test promptly and continue to integrate security
  testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Goal**: Begin formalizing prototypes for SSO (Single Sign-On) and mTLS integration for future
  scalability.

---

#### 3. Full Implementation of Tutor Activity Tracking

The backend schema and frontend UI for this feature are in place, but they need to be fully
integrated and activated.

- **Priority**: Connect the frontend dashboard to live backend data instead of the current dummy
  data.
- **Action**: Implement the `Session Tracker Service` to manage marking sessions and integrate it
  across all related entities (User, Unit, Project, Task).
- **Goal**: Deploy backend endpoints to retrieve `Marking Sessions` and `Session Activities` for
  analytics and reporting.

---

#### 4. Deploying Accessibility and Color Blindness Features

The foundational research and design for accessibility were completed in T2. The next step is full
implementation and deployment.

- **Priority**: Deploy the configurable color themes, including presets for various types of color
  vision deficiencies like deuteranopia and protanopia.
- **Action**: Integrate the theme selector into user profile settings and conduct user testing to
  validate the effectiveness of the new themes.

---

#### 5. Expanding OnTrack Documentation

Efforts to centralize documentation should continue to support new team members.

- **Priority**: Create the "Getting Started" onboarding guide series that was planned in previous
  trimesters.
- **Action**: Finalize API reference pages for all new and refactored endpoints to ensure the
  documentation is comprehensive and current.

---

#### 6. Long-Term Feature Development (Backlog)

These items from previous roadmaps or new T2 proposals are still in the backlog for future
development.

- **Panopto Video Integration**: This feature, including phase 2 explorations, is fully scoped but
  remains in the backlog for a future implementation.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Expand on the new initiative to use Google Lighthouse to
  systematically test and improve platform speed and accessibility.
- **Gamification**: Explore the feasibility of development of the gamification strategy proposed in
  T2 to boost user engagement through interactive UI elements.

### Open Issues

This section flags persistent issues that may interfere with the future team's ability to work and
provides advice on how these could be addressed. Despite steady progress on deliverables, several
challenges remain that could impact the continuity and learning outcomes for the next cohort.

---

#### Skills Gap & Onboarding Challenges

Many students join OnTrack to learn, but the steep learning curve for technologies like Angular,
TypeScript, and legacy CoffeeScript can be a significant barrier.

- Without structured technical onboarding, new members often spend the first 3–4 weeks trying to
  understand the system, which delays their ability to contribute effectively.
- There is often an implicit expectation that students are already proficient with the tech stack
  (including Git, Docker, and Angular), which is not always the case and can lead to frustration.

---

#### Development Environment & Compatibility Issues

Setting up the local development environment remains a significant hurdle, especially for students
using Windows machines.

- Docker image sizes are large, and performance differences compared to Mac or Linux systems can
  create an uneven development experience.
- Compatibility differences between the `8.0.x` and `9.x` branches can lead to frequent and
  confusing build issues.
- These issues had a direct impact this trimester, as the penetration testing scheduled for
  mid-August was delayed partly due to "various build errors."

---

#### Fragmented Review and Contribution Workflow

The process for reviewing Planner board tasks and GitHub pull requests can lack consistency.

- Without clear ownership and review pathways, some completed work can sit idle in pull requests for
  long periods, waiting for approvals. This can slow down overall project momentum.

---

#### Recommendations for Future Teams

To mitigate these issues, the next team should consider the following:

- **Introduce a structured onboarding program** that covers environment setup, Git workflows, and an
  introduction to the core tech stack.
- **Create and maintain a beginner-friendly setup guide**, especially for Windows environments.
- **Communicate early and often with mentors** or sub-leads to get help and unblock technical issues
  quickly.
- **Leverage the resources** in the **[User Manual](#user-manual)** section, which contains setup

Throughout the trimester, the OnTrack team gained valuable insights into collaboration, workflow
management, and technical readiness. The following lessons are shared to help future teams adopt
practices that support sustained progress and learning.

---

#### The Importance of Mentorship

Mentors play a pivotal role in clarifying complex tasks and keeping the team aligned with project
goals. Low attendance in mentor meetings can create knowledge gaps, leading to missed updates and
slower progress.

- **Key Takeaway**: Prioritize regular engagement with mentors to stay informed and unblock
  technical or process-related issues early.

---

#### Effective Task Management

Consistent use of the Planner board is essential for transparency and progress tracking.

- When tasks are left un-updated, it can cause confusion around team progress and individual
  responsibilities.
- **Key Takeaway**: Familiarity with Planner, clear card ownership, and regular status updates are
  crucial for maintaining momentum in collaborative work.

---

#### Technical Readiness and Continuous Learning

A significant number of contributors can struggle with tasks due to limited experience with GitHub
and the core tech stack. This can impact review cycles and slow down delivery.

- **Key Takeaway**: Capstone projects require continuous upskilling. Proactively allocate time for
  learning core technologies like Git, Angular, and TypeScript, especially when entering unfamiliar
  domains. It is highly recommended that new members undergo early training.

---

#### Time Management and Self-Discipline

Delayed deliverables are often linked to weak time management. Without consistent planning and
progress tracking, it's difficult to meet sprint goals.

- **Key Takeaway**: Adopt strategies like weekly planning, setting personal deadlines, and using
  reminders to stay on track and contribute reliably.

---

#### Final Advice

New team members may assume deep technical knowledge is required before contributing. However, what
truly matters is **consistency, communication, and a willingness to learn**. Investing time early to
understand the workflow, connect with mentors, and get comfortable with the tools will lead to
strong contributions.

### Product Development Life Cycle

We continue to use Agile methodologies to deliver updates and new features for OnTrack. Our approach
includes 2-week sprints focused on completing tasks, and weekly stand-up meetings to assess
progress, share updates, discuss roadblocks, and assign new tasks via Teams Planner cards.

---

#### New Tasks

- New tasks are assigned by the project mentor during weekly stand-up meetings.
- Once assigned a task, be sure to assign yourself to the corresponding Teams Planner card and
  attach your draft or completed pull request when you begin work.
- If you have an idea for a new feature, schedule a meeting with the project mentor to discuss it.
  Upon approval, a new card can be created in the Planner backlog.
- For large features, it is recommended to first create a Spike document to research the benefits
  and challenges, which can be committed to the documentation repository.

---

#### Definition of Done

A task is considered complete once it has been fully tested, functions as expected, is documented in
a well-organized pull request, has been peer-reviewed, and is approved by your mentor. The
corresponding Teams Planner card must be updated, and communication with your reviewer and mentor
should continue until your contribution is merged.

---

#### Task Review

- Each pull request requires a mandatory peer review before a mentor can review it.
- After creating a pull request, contact a teammate to review it and tag them as the reviewer in
  both the Planner card and on GitHub.
- As a reviewer, you must test the code by pulling the changes locally and reviewing the syntax,
  logic, and output.
- After the peer review is complete, notify the mentor for their final review and approval before
  the pull request is submitted to the upstream repository.

---

#### Testing

- For frontend changes, test the functionality in the browser and run specification tests as needed.
- For backend changes, use browser interactions or tools like Postman to test API functionality.
- In the pull request, include detailed instructions on how others can test your changes, and always
  provide before-and-after screenshots to show the outcome.

---

#### Branching Strategy

- When starting new work, fork all three `thoth-tech` repositories (`deploy`, `web`, and `api`) to
  your personal GitHub profile.
- Create a new branch from the `9.x` branch of the relevant repository.
- Follow the **Branch Prefixes and Commit Message Format** in the official Contributing Guide when
  naming branches and creating commits.

### Product Architecture

OnTrack is developed as a collaborative open-source project built on top of the Doubtfire-LMS
ecosystem. It comprises four key components:

- **Doubtfire-Web**: The frontend application responsible for user interface and interactions, built
  using Angular.
- **Doubtfire-API**: The backend service that handles business logic and communicates with the
  database, built using Ruby on Rails.
- **Database**: A structured relational database (e.g., MariaDB) that stores all persistent
  application data.
- **Doubtfire-Deploy**: Infrastructure scripts and configuration used to deploy OnTrack in a stable
  and maintainable environment, primarily using Docker and associated CI/CD tools.

OnTrack is maintained and enhanced by **ThothTech**, a student-led capstone development team at
Deakin University. The project is **forked from the official Doubtfire-LMS repository**, which is
managed by Company Directors and Mentors. The LMS environment represents the **production-grade
implementation**, while ThothTech serves as the innovation space where new features and improvements
are developed before potential upstream contribution.

---

#### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Currently being migrated from AngularJS and CoffeeScript to Angular 17 and
  TypeScript. The stack also includes HTML, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS.

- **Backend**: Built on Ruby on Rails with the Grape Framework. It uses MariaDB as the database
  engine, and Docker is used for deployment and local development.

### Roadmap

#### SplashKit Expansion

- Add more unit tests for functions that do not have them yet
- Add the required SplashKit libraries to the existing NuGet package with a proper icon,
  description, and documentation of the packaging process.
- Port the SplashKit framework to Rust, expanding its accessibility and allowing developers using
  Rust to take advantage of SplashKit’s features and capabilities.
- Investigate and fix the issues with Pascal programs memory leaks after compilation with FPC.
- Investigate different strategies to allow for unit testing specifically with graphics
  functionality
- Revise and fix issues with Raspberry Pi code ensuring things are fixed and the RPi suite is
  expanded
- The fix to the repeated suffixes issue found in some of the SplashKit functions

#### SplashKit Website

#### SplashKit Online

- **Pipeline Upgrades**: One of the initivates started this trimester was the reworking of the file
  structure to support C# and the new file strcure. Work should be continued to optimise this and
  add support for a code checker.
- **Code Checker**: One of the initivates discussed with Hard Hat was a code checker to check code
  prior to deployment of games to SK online or to the arcade machine. This should be pursued so that
  students in future can more easily deploy games to the site.
- **Improve C++ Support**: C++ has seen improvements this trimester, though more work needs to be
  done to find minor issues that are present such as missing header gaurds ect. Also consider
  updating the version of SplashKit used.
- **Imporove C# Support**: While C# support has improved this trimester, more work needs to be done
  to implement classes such as Window that will allow for rendering of graphics.
- **Game Upload**: Work should start on adding a easier way for students to add games to the project
  without having to rebuild the site.
