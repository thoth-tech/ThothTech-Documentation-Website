## Project 1 - OnTrack

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

OnTrack, also known as Doubtfire, is an innovative Learning Management System (LMS) designed
specifically for skill-based course delivery. This platform enhances the connection between tutors
and students, with a primary focus on Deakin University and other global educational institutions.
OnTrack aims to elevate the educational experience by offering a structured, efficient, and
interactive learning environment. The system is crafted to improve student engagement, boost
learning outcomes, and streamline the teaching and learning process, benefiting both students and
educators.

The OnTrack team is dedicated to continuously improving the platform by working on all planned
deliverables each trimester. While the team strives to complete all objectives, any remaining
deliverables are carried forward, encouraging the next generation of leaders to take ownership and
drive the project forward. This approach ensures the long-term sustainability and evolution of
OnTrack, fostering a culture of responsibility, innovation, and continuous enhancement for the
benefit of future users.

Additionally, our team aims to maintain the quality of our work and improve the usability of
OnTrack. This includes fixing bugs, improving workflows, and making the platform more accessible for
all users. For example, we worked on adding colour themes to support students with colour blindness,
reducing barriers for those users. We also prioritize documentation and transparency. By keeping
clear records of what’s done, what’s in progress, and what’s next, we make sure new teams can pick
up where we left off without guessing. We understand that documentation saves time, prevents
repeated mistakes, and helps the project grow faster.

Other key goals include:

- Responding to feedback – We have a strict peer review process that allows us to learn from each
  other.

- Promoting sustainability – By writing clean, maintainable code and clear handover notes, we keep
  OnTrack stable and ready for future development.

Our objective is simple: leave OnTrack better than we found it and make the next team’s start
easier.

Significant progress has been made in supporting organisational structure this trimester:

- The Observer Role has been developed and deployed, enabling administrative oversight without
  direct intervention privileges.
- Database migration for multi-organisation support has been finalized.

#### Tutor Activity Tracking

Backend development for Tutor Times is progressing well. Key achievements include:

- The database schema has been updated to introduce a Marking Session table, enabling accurate
  tracking of marking periods associated with tutors and units.
- A Session Activities table has been added to systematically log user interactions, such as actions
  taken during task assessment, supporting improved analytics and reporting.

Next steps involve:

- Creating a Session Tracker Service to manage marking sessions based on a 15-minute activity
  threshold, tracking activities such as accessing and updating tasks.
- Integrating the Session Tracker Service across related entities, including User, Unit, Project,
  and Task.
- Implementing endpoints to retrieve Marking Sessions and Session Activities for enhanced
  visualization and analytics.

#### Self-Enrolment & Capstone Enhancements

_Progress update pending._

#### OnTrack Documentation Website

Documentation efforts are progressing well this trimester. Setup guides have been updated with clear
instructions for building on branch 9.x, and the team is now focused on consolidating documentation
across all OnTrack projects to ensure consistency and comprehensive coverage.

#### New Feature Explorations

This trimester, two innovative proposals have been introduced to further enhance OnTrack:

- A performance benchmarking initiative using Google Lighthouse, proposed by Mostafa Nouri, aims to
  systematically evaluate and improve the platform’s speed, accessibility, and overall user
  experience.
- A gamification strategy for the OnTrack UI, proposed by Joseph Kalayathankal Saji, is designed to
  boost user engagement through interactive and motivational elements.

Both proposals are currently being developed and integrated into the Doubtfire-Astro repository,
with ongoing expansion and refinement.

#### Staff Grant Extention

The staff grant extension feature has progressed significantly this trimester. A dedicated page has
been developed to enable staff to grant extensions, and the necessary backend API endpoints are now
in place.

Next steps include finalizing the routing for the Staff Grant Extension (SGE) page, integrating the
backend and frontend components, and ensuring that notification systems—both in-system and
email—function reliably for all extension requests.

#### Courseflow 

The Courseflow project has progressed quite far this trimester. The ability to mark units as complete 
and a skills summary feature have been successfully implemented, providing clearer progress tracking for 
students.

Next steps include working on below features: 
- Implementing filtering options
- Tracking credit points achieved
- Developing an overlay component to display detailed information on completed units

## Project 2 - SplashKit

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

SplashKit is an open-source software development framework designed to simplify game and application
developement for beginners and students. It was primarily coded in C++ but has since offer supports
for addition languages such as C#, Python, Pascal, and JavaScript.

SplashKit provides users with a set of pre-built libraries for graphics, sound, input handlindg and
more, making it easier to create interactive applications. It also offers an extensive documentation
and tutorials designed to help students get started quickly and maximise their use of the SDK. This
wealth of resources empowers learners to progress at their own pace and fully explore the
capabilities of SplashKit, making it an invaluable tool for both beginners and more advanced users.

SplashKit will be running with the following projects during T2 2025:

#### **SplashKit Website & Tutorials**

Powered by the Starlight framework, the revamped SplashKit website aims to offer an enriched and
user-friendly experience for developers and learners. The SplashKit Website will also feature
tutorials aimed at helping students learn and explore SplashKit’s functionality. The focus is on
developing smaller, high-quality tutorials across C++, C#, and Python, rather than extensive series.

#### **SplashKit Expansion**

The Expansion team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the SplashKit core. This includes
bug fixes, feature improvements, units testing, and refining installation and usage workflows
through package creation and addressing installation issues.

#### **SplashKit Online**

SplashKit Online is developing a web-based IDE that allows students to write and run code directly
in their browsers. Initially launched as a prototype in 2023, the 2025 goal is to mature this tool
into a comprehensive product, including further C# support and refining the embedded version for the
SplashKit website.

#### **Arcade Machines**

The university has acquired four arcade machines equipped with Raspberry Pi 3B+ units, designed to
showcase games developed with SplashKit. The short-term goal is to prepare these platforms for
students to display their SplashKit creations. The medium-term goal is to streamline the process for
first-year students to easily upload and test their games.

### Aims for Trimester

Trimester Aims for SplashKit Development:

#### **Expand Project Management Features on SplashKit Online**

For SplashKit Online, a key objective is to add tools for creating, saving, laoding, and managing
multiple projects with version control. Additionally, version control integration will be
implemented to improve project tracking, collaboration, and organization.

#### **Improvement of Communication and Coordination between Teams**

This trimester, we aim to enhance communication and coordination between teams by establishing
clearer workflows, improving cross-team collaboration, and streamlining project management
processes. Our focus will be on implementing structured communication channels, ensuring that
development, testing, and documentation teams are aligned and working efficiently. We will continue
regular stand up meetings, feedback loops, and collaborative tools to facilitate seamless
information sharing and faster issue resolution.

#### **Develop and Refine Unit Tests for SplashKit**

To ensure high software quality, we will be looking at developing an array for unit tests for
SplashKit as well as looking into inconsistencies with previous unit tests made to ensure we achieve
the desired outcome and maintain industry standards.

#### **Improve Project Documentation**

A key objective this trimester is to enhance project documentation by ensuring all information is
up-to-date and aligned with the current workflow. This will involve regularly reviewing, updating,
and organizing documentation to improve clarity, accessibility, and usability for all team members.

#### **Expansion of the SplashKit Website Usage Examples and Beyond SplashKit**

The SplashKit Website team will be attempting to go through the backlogs of Usage Examples to
further enhance the user experience on the site while also creating more resources for Beyond
SplashKit, offering users the opportunity to learn how to code these functions without SplashKit.
