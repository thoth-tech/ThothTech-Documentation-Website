## Trimester Goals and Objectives

This trimester, Thoth Tech aims to achieve the following:

### Goal 1: Foster Professional Growth and a Collaborative Team Culture

- **Encourage Lifelong Learning and Skill Development**: A core tenant of our products, OnTrack and
  SplashKit is to provide a supportive environment where students and beginners can take ownership
  of their learning. OnTrack is a tool to keep your learning “on track,” and beginner programmers
  can “make a splash” with SplashKit. Our hope is that these tools give students confidence and
  develops their mindset to become lifelong learners.
- **Promote Initiative and Teamwork**: As a team, we seek to empower team members to take ownership
  of their work while encouraging a collaborative culture built on mutual responsibility and shared
  success.
- **Develop Clear and Accessible Documentation**: To support students and beginners in their
  journey, it is imperative that rich documentation and tutorials accompany our tools. This feeds
  into the lifelong learning goal by teaching students’ habits of self-education and reading
  documentation.

### Goal 2: Strengthen and expand our products

- **Migrate features to newer, secure versions**: To keep our products relevant and ensure they meet
  evolving user needs, we are expanding and/or migrating our products to new languages and
  frameworks, such as from Angular.js to Angular and JavaScript to TypeScript in OnTrack, as well as
  improving C# support in SplashKit.
- **Address critical bugs and security vulnerabilities**: We will prioritise fixing high-impact bugs
  and security issues to maintain a high standard of quality, reliability, and safety in our
  products.
- **Improve user experience**: We will prioritise fixing high-impact bugs and security issues to
  maintain a high standard of quality, reliability, and safety in our products.
- **Improve user experience**: Across our products, we aim to improve self-serve capability such as
  self-enrolment, tutor activity tracking and staff granting of extensions in OnTrack, user game
  upload to SplashKit online and improved package management for SplashKit Core. We will also
  improve accessibility with colour themes for those with impaired colour vision in OnTrack.

### Goal 3: Improve project governance & transparency

- **Improve alignment between goals, roadmap, and tasks**: At present, there are enhancements and
  fixes in the T2 2025 roadmap, both short- and long-term, that our planner board tasks do not
  represent. We seek to improve the alignment between our longer-term roadmap, shorter-term goals,
  and immediate-term tasks – this will provide a clearer vision on what work needs doing to further
  what we are building.
- **Clean up pull requests in our repositories**: Previous company members have completed some tasks
  in our planner boards, with code that the maintainers have reviewed and accepted on GitHub. We aim
  to accept pull requests for completed works where relevant, and to close out the associated user
  stories.
- **Improve opportunities for contribution**: By improving the alignment of our roadmap, goals and
  tasks, and by having better and more detailed user stories in our planner boards, we will give
  junior team members a better sense of direction and therefore a better opportunity to build their
  technical confidence and capability when contributing to an ongoing project.
- **Improve user experience**: Across our products, we aim to improve self-serve capability such as
  self-enrolment, tutor activity tracking and staff granting of extensions in OnTrack, user game
  upload to SplashKit online and improved package management for SplashKit Core. We will also
  improve accessibility with colour themes for those with impaired colour vision in OnTrack.

## Project 1 - OnTrack

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

OnTrack (a.k.a. Doubtfire, Formatif) is a modern, lightweight learning management system that
multiple universities Australia-wide make use of. While the base product is stable and useful, our
work here intends to uplift the product to newer frameworks, roll out new features, and patch
security vulnerabilities. Improvements made to this project have the potential to positively impact
students in the institutions that use OnTrack.

### Aims for Trimester

This trimester, the OnTrack team at Thoth Tech will build upon the foundational work of T2 2025 to
continue modernizing and expanding platform functionality, accessibility, and performance. Our focus
will be on completing high-priority migrations, implementing user-focused features, and reinforcing
system security and documentation standards. The following areas are targeted for completion or
significant progress:

## Project 2 - SplashKit

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

SplashKit is an open-source software framework designed for beginners and students, to simplify
application and game development. The core SplashKit framework was initially developed in C++, but
support has now been added for C#, Python, Pascal, and JavaScript; beyond the core framework, the
project also encompasses an online IDE, physical arcade machines, and a website and tutorials.

This trimester 3 2025, we will be running the following projects aligned with the above:

#### **SplashKit Website & Tutorials**

The SplashKit website aims to offer user-friendly installation instructions and tutorials aimed at
helping beginners and students explore SplashKit’s functionality. Work for this team will include
expanding usage examples and tutorials across the supported languages, continuing to improve the
user interface by leveraging Tailwind CSS, Preline, and existing component libraries, and improving
the Netlify build process.

#### **SplashKit Expansion**

The SplashKit Expansion team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the SplashKit Core
Library. This will include bug fixes, unit testing, adding SplashKit to the NuGet package manager,
and feature enhancements.

#### **SplashKit Online**

This team is responsible for the online IDE. Work in this team will include improving C++ and C#
support, as well reworking the file structure to better support C#. Beyond this, our roadmap for
this product includes a code checker to check code prior to deployment on SplashKit Online or the
arcade machine, and – aligned with checking code before deployment – an easier way for students to
add games to SplashKit Online without having to rebuild the site.

#### **SplashKit Arcade**

In prior trimesters, the SplashKit team have obtained and deployed physical arcade cabinets
containing Raspberry Pi 5 and 3B+ computers, designed to showcase games developed with SplashKit.
Test machines were developed in T2 2025, along with demonstration games; the focus now will be on
maintenance of the arcade game hardware, bug fixes for the machines and the games previously
created, and implementation of an API to improve controller support.

### Aims for Trimester

#### **Improve Stability and Reliability**

We will work to address several outstanding bugs in the SplashKit Core library and in games created
for SplashKit Arcade; depending on resource availability, bug fixing work is required for SplashKit
Arcade hardware as well.

#### **Develop and Refine Unit Tests for SplashKit Core**

Continuing this goal from T2 2025, we aim to continue building a suit of unit tests for SplashKit as
well as making sure existing unit tests are consistent and comply with best practices.

#### **Begin Implementation of SplashKit into NuGet**

Further to the roadmap set out by the T2 2025 team, we will work to add SplashKit to the NuGet
package manager, ensuring it has a proper icon and description. In parallel, we will document this
packaging process.

#### **Improve User Experience & Accessibility**

We will work to improve the UI/UX of the SplashKit website, and to enhance tutorials and
documentation with clearer examples and better language coverage.

#### **Expansion of the SplashKit Website Usage Examples and Beyond SplashKit**

The SplashKit Website team will be attempting to go through the backlogs of Usage Examples to
further enhance the user experience on the site while also creating more resources for Beyond
SplashKit, offering users the opportunity to learn how to code these functions without SplashKit.

### Deliverables – T3 2025

#### SplashKit Website & Tutorials

We have a small team this trimester, so this trimester we will focus our attention on the following
deliverables:

**Trimester Deliverables:**

- Improved and expanded unit tests for SplashKit Core.
- Meaningful progress on inclusion of SplashKit in NuGet package manager.
- Resolved bugs in SplashKit Arcade demonstration games.
- Resolved SplashKit Core bugs related to macOS, pending resource availability.
- Enhanced tutorials and documentation on the SplashKit website.

**Longer-term objectives unlikely to be completed this trimester are:**

- **Bug fixes to SplashKit Arcade hardware** – only one member of our small team has selected
  SplashKit Arcade as their area of interest, and campus availability and access to the machines is
  not yet clear.
- **Implementation of a controller API for Arcade Machine hardware.** As above, this requires access
  to the hardware.
- **Porting SplashKit Core to Rust.** This is a large piece of work, and no team member has
  specified Rust as an area of knowledge.
- **Investigating a Pascal memory leak in SplashKit Core.** Like the above, no team member has
  specified Pascal as an area of knowledge, and fixing a memory leak does not sound like a good
  beginner’s problem with a new language.
- **Unit tests for graphics functions.** This was mentioned as a roadmap item by the T2 2025 team;
  this is a good idea in principle but might prove too much for our small team – it would likely
  involve decoupling graphics logic/algorithms from the rendering API and may require refactoring of
  existing graphics code to be implemented.
