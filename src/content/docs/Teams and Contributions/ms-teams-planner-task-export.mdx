To help with assembling the company reports/handover documents, we have a Python script that fetches
the current tasks from the MS Teams Planner board and exports them as a `csv`, for inclusion as a
table in the document. It uses the Microsoft Graph API to access the data.

The script can be found [here](/scripts/MSTeamsPlannerExportScript.py). It's pretty simple to use,
and for a step-by-step guide see below:

## Steps

<Steps>

1. **Open the Terminal**

   Open up your favourite terminal, and navigate it to where you'd like the resulting `csv` file to
   be saved.

2. **Download and Run the Script**

   Copy and paste the following command into your terminal, then press **Enter**:

   <Code
     code="curl -O <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thoth-tech/ThothTech-Documentation-Website/refs/heads/main/public/scripts/MSTeamsPlannerExportScript.py> && python MSTeamsPlannerExportScript.py"
     lang="bash"
   ></Code>

   This just downloads the Python script mentioned above, and runs it. The script doesn't require
   any additional dependencies, and _should_ work on any platform.

3. **Authorize the Script**

   Once the script runs, it'll show something as follows:

   ```shell
   --------------------
   Welcome to the MS Teams Planner Export Script!
   --------------------

   Please go to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter this code: <Code Goes Here>
   Waiting for user authorization... (Will check again in 5 seconds)
   ```

   Simply navigate to that URL in your browser, and enter the code - this will authorize the script
   to read your planner board/tasks, and basic user data (to retrieve member names, etc).

4. **Choose a Planner Board**

   Once authorized, a list of planner boards you have access to will appear, e.g:

   ```shell
   --------------------
   Fetching accessible plans/boards
   --------------------

   Here are the list of plans you can choose from:
   0) Reload options
   1) SplashKit
   2) OnTrack Project
   3) The Activity List

   If you don't see the one you are expecting, make sure you have opened that plan at least once in Tea
   ms - then choose option 0 to reload.
   Please select a plan to fetch data from, by the number beside it.
   >
   ```

   Just type in the number beside the board you want to export data from, and press enter.

   If you don't see the one you are expecting, make sure you have opened that plan at least once in
   MS Teams - then choose option 0 to reload.

   Once you choose a board, it'll fetch the task data!

   ```shell
   > 1
   You have selected 'SplashKit', which has the ID mIelcQoIgkqhbM8WaPS3sMgAEmyV

   --------------------
   Fetching tasks...
   --------------------

   Fetching more...
   487 tasks fetched!

   ```

   Here I've chosen the SplashKit board.

5. **Choose the Export Format**

   Next it'll ask which format you'd like to export as; you'll probably want `document` for company
   reports. You can also use `raw` mode, which will also output the task's bucket, along with
   unassigned tasks - this can be useful for further analysis.

   ```shell
   --------------------
   Format Selection
   --------------------

   Are we exporting the raw data, or the data needed for company documents/handovers? (raw, document)
   > document
   ```

   Here I've chosen `document` mode.

6. **Choose Which Buckets to Export**

   Now you can choose which buckets to export. You can enter a comma delimited set of numbers for
   which buckets you would like to export data from (e.g `1,4,5`). You can also use @ and then a
   word to select all buckets with that word (e.g `1,7,@Complete`)

   Enter `ALL` to export all of them

   ```shell
   --------------------
   Bucket Selection
   --------------------

   Please enter a comma delimited set of numbers for which buckets you would like to export data from (
   e.g 1,4,5).
   You may also use @ and then a word to select all buckets with that word (e.g 1,7,@Complete)
   Enter ALL to export all of them.
   --------------------
   1) Game Dev - Backlog
   2) Arcade Machine - Backlog
   3) Complete
   4) Mentor Review - Olivia
   5) Mentor Review - Sean
   6) Second Peer Review
   7) First Peer Review
   8) Doing
   9) Usage Examples - Backlog
   10) Splashkit Website - Backlog
   11) Splashkit Expansion - Backlog
   12) Splashkit Online - Backlog
   --------------------
   > @Review,@Complete

   You have selected the following buckets:
   --------------------
   Mentor Review - Olivia
   Mentor Review - Sean
   Second Peer Review
   First Peer Review
   Complete
   --------------------
   Is this correct? (y/n)
   > y
   ```

   Here I've chosen a common one, `@Review,@Complete`, to export all tasks in review/complete
   buckets.

7. **Done!**

   Finally it'll begin exporting! This can take some time, since it still needs to gather additional
   information for each task (such as attachments, etc).

   ```shell
   Buckets selected - we can export the data now!

   --------------------
   Exporting...
   --------------------

   --------------------
   Finished! You can find the output at SplashKit_Tasks_2024-12-11T07-57-48.csv
   --------------------
   ```

   Once it's finished you can find the output inside the same folder you opened the terminal in!
