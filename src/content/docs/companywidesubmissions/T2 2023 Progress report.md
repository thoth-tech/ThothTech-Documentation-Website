8 Products - Company Operations This team oversees the entire operations of Thoth Tech and strivto make things easier. We aim to make the onboarding process as smooth and clear as possible, as
well as increase the knowledge of our seniors in meaningful ways while creating policies to improve the wellbeing of all company employees. In the short term, we would like to create new
documentation, policies, workflows, and processes that are relevant to improve the company’s
outlook and overall productivity. In the long term, we aim to store documentations in a dedicated
website (Docusaurus) to make it easy to push updates, new features, and bug fixes to everyone
without the need to gain access to our GitHub repository. Projects • Documentation Website: The
goal of this project is to deliver a website that serves as a location for all company documents,
this would help eradicate document management and retrieval issues ensuring everyone has full
access to the documents they need to function in the company. • Policy creation: The goal of this
project is to create policies that would guide every member of Thoth Tech in using tools and
technologies adopted by the company. This focuses on areas like GitHub, Trello, creating
documents, using the Documentation website, and so on. • Documentation: This involves documenting
every work and activity necessary for project and business continuity. Every plan and outcome for
a project is being documented and currently stored in the Company Operations GitHub repository,
the end goal is for all documentation to be stored in the documentation website being created
(Starlight). Aims for Trimester • Develop a policy for git-workflow. • Create a policy for Trello
and the processes associated with it. • Describe and document the steps required to progress a
change through a product. 6 • Introduce a new onboarding document for the Ontrack product. •
Explore the use of Docusaurus for storing documentation. • Generate code standard to be used for
all product deployment. • Ensure group OnTrack tasks are completed to a satisfactory standard. •
Write a list of new tasks for the documentation team to begin building. Deliverables • Generated

will be working dynamically across a variety of projects. We will be working based on a priority
system to get as many useful changes implemented as possible in the trimester. We will be breaking
each project into smaller subcomponents to allow people to work across projects in areas that are
strong at or interested in. Everything should be completable in a 2-week sprint. Projects • Numbas
Integration – We are integrating the Numbas mathematics tests into the Ontrack Workflow, so tests
can be taken during the submission process and can be incorporated into the workflow to complete a
submission based on passing or failing the test. • Migration Front End – We have migrated a lot of
our components to the later version of Angular, however there still a range of components that need
to be migrated to FX layout with Tailwind. • Terminators – This a project to resolve bugs that are
in the system, there are a few key ones we want to focus on first, and any additional bugs will also
be added into this backlog. • Improvers – This a project to enhance some of our existing features
with new functionality, there are a range of different features we want to enhance. • Inventors –
This project is to scope out and start the build of new features we want including in the system,
again there is a range of new features, and they are at various stages of development. 12 • Data
Analytics – This project has taken a step back, we will be reviewing the progress last trimester and
coming up with a new project plan and design on how we want to deliver this. • Attendance Module –
We want to create an attendance module; in that you can use SSO from different organisations like
google/GitHub or other universities to log into the system. Aims for Trimester • Complete the Numbas
Integration into Ontrack • Migrate legacy Angular components to FX layout with tailwind (Migrators)
• Feature enhancements (Terminators) • Feature enhancers (Improvers) • New Features (Inventors) •
Data Analytics - New project plan, review of previous work completed, New Project Aims document. •
Authentication module – Design and plan for the module to be built. Deliverables Our main
deliverables will be based on story points completed in the Trello tasks; we are aiming for students
to complete between 5-6 Story points every 2-week sprint. Short Term Deliverables (This trimester):
• Numbas PoC Completed • Numbas direct integration 70% complete • 50% of Angular migration
completed. • All bugs resolved. • New features mapped out ready for next trimester. • Review of Data
Analytics and Plan to move it forward. • Scope for Authentication Module Long Term Deliverables
(Ongoing): 13 • All Angular migrations completed. • Enhance features mapped out in Trimester. •
Develop new features. • Create Data Analytics platform. • Authentication Module created. • Card Scan

Roadmap The current road map for Ontrack is quite broad, however there are a few key projects that
we want to focus on next trimester, first you can view all the backlogs on the Trello board with
their associated tasks: https://trello.com/invite/b/IKabVmzt/ATTIdf935d63730a48bee701a76b199f48fc61BF23A8/ ontrack The Key
projects we would like to see movement on next trimester would be:
1. Improvements Backlog – This backlog has core improvements to the system we want to see.
2. Ontrack Bugs Backlog – These are bugs that are found and added to this backlog.
3. New Feature – Incorporate Content – Ideally, we have an additional 2 designs of how this would
work. It's not ready to code just yet.
4. New Feature – Staff Grant Extensions – Ideally, we have an additional 2 designs of how this would
work. It's not ready to code just yet.
5. New Feature – Tutor Times – Ideally, we have 2 additional designs on how this would work. It's
not ready to code just yet.
6. Backlog Urgent Enhancements – These are important changes we are looking to get done asap. 22
7. Documentation – We want to focus on updating the Front and Backend Documentation and testing in
the next trimester. This will help students and other users better understand the system and how
it works. 3.4. Open Issues • Getting the system running, some students had issues getting Ontrack
setup, we have made a lot of videos and documentation to aid this as well as implemented a
development container but it's still an issue. • Understanding OnTrack's UML and how new features
link into it. • Upskilling to work on a complex Angular/Rails system – We have provided training
videos and links to upskill. • Testing code and Pull requests – there have been issues with
making pull requests as per the documentation provided, as this is a live system it's important
to fully ready and understand the requirements when making a PR. • Using GitHub, GitHub is new to
some students and can be quite tricky to get working how you want. There were several videos and
training sessions to help this. 3.5. Source Code • Doubtfire Web - https:

8. Product – Art Gallery Indigenous and rural artists often face barriers in accessing the broader
market, limiting their opportunities for income and recognition. Our platform seeks to eliminate
these 23 barriers by leveraging modern technology to empower artists to reach a wider consumer
base, while bringing diverse cultures together. We aim to deliver a highly available and scalable
ecommerce platform that will allow for ease of sale of artwork by small local artists. We plan to
do this with our easily maintained C# minimal RESTful API, Vue frontend, and our suite of other
technologies used in streamlining the development pf our product. 4.1. Team Members and Their Key

done in depth research into making this possible and provided us with several review documents.In addition to this, he has also provided us with cybersecurity strategies for our deployment,
this includes research into the payment system we will need to integrate, and safe storage of
user data and login credentials. All completed deliverables can be found on GitHub. • Aldocuments can be found here: https: //github.com/thothtech/documentation/pull/429/files Chloe has been responsible for upgrading the backend this trimester. She has migrated the API to .NET 8,
and updated the requisite Docker containers to account for this change. She has also integrated
asynchrony into the Repository Pattern of the API, and created some automated test scripts in
Postman to thoroughly test each endpoint. She has also made some significant changes to the
frontend in preparation for InnoFes. This includes implementing a gallery style view for artwork
display, and a Lightbox to showcase individual artworks. She has also ensured that the price of
each artwork can be displayed, which required adding a column to the artwork table in the
database, then updating the API and frontend to include this change. All completed deliverables
can be found on GitHub. • Asynchrony integration: Implement asynchrony on RP/media context,

Frontend changes: Modifying Artworks to be in Gallery View + Lightbox • Including Price on
Artworks: Adding Price to Artwork Card Component, Adding Price to Database and API on Artworks
4.3. Roadmap To be completed: • Integrate IIIF into API for better quality image display •
Implementing redesign of Front end web app • Deploying the product • Integrating payment system
into front end • Integrate Postman tests into GitHub Actions CI workflow In progress: • Continued
redesign of Frontend web app. We only have some pages redesigned at the moment, and these are not
yet finalized. We need to finalize our upgraded designs. • Continue to implement lighthouse
recommendations. We have improved performance related scores but need to work on our other scores
still. 4.4. Open Issues • The team itself is quite small with certain members lack coding
expertise for the next phase of the application. It may be hard to achieve what we want to with
this project without recruiting individuals with stronger coding skills, given that the
application is still in its infancy. • Automated testing needs to be implemented in our CI
workflow in GitHub Actions, faulty code had been pushed in our repository and resulted in our app
breaking. At present, we still do not have a thorough way to prevent this from happening again.
4.5. Source Code All of our source code is stored in GitHub in our art-gallery repository. 27 Our
redesigns are done in our Figma board: https:

4.6. Login Credentials Database - username: postgres, password: PostgreSQL 4.7. Other Relevant
Information Documentation and research regarding deployment is extensive with many helpful
resources on errors and checks related to CI/CD as well. Using these resources will help and
streamline the deployment of the application. Implementing the automated testing in the CI
workflow will be really helpful, we had some issues this trimester with students pushing code
that broke the application. It is a strong recommendation that preventing this be made a focus
early in the following trimester. Integrating a payment system into our frontend should be a
focus as well, given that this is the entire business model of our platform. If students wish to
work on ‘documentation only’ projects, or do not have strong frontend programming skills, it is
advised they select a different project to work on. If there are any technical issues in
developing the project, Max is a great help and should be a port of call for the product lead
when advice is needed. We have 3 implementations in our API, however the only one in use is
‘repository pattern’. Please disregard the other versions as they are now legacy. The client
would still like to keep these implementations in our repo, however they are to be ignored! 4.8.

 Login Page Using Google o'auth 5.3. Roadmap See Card Status in Backlog for Additional details
and Completed Research Cards. SplashKit Arcade • Create an automated game download system for
Arcade Machines o The proposed system will use the Arcade-games Repo to check for updates in the
game version and download the latest version o Games should have a Publish tag or similar to be
loaded to the main menu. o Have a secondary game menu for test games/non-published. 35 • Updates
to Arcade Menu o Presently the Arcade machine uses Emulation Station forked from the RetorPI
project version. https: //github.com/thoth-tech/ArcadeMenu o Create a new system for test games o
See if we can modify the EM menu for the following ▪ Trigger Game download scripts ▪ Additional
modes ▪ Kiosk – Only show Published Games (for Events) ▪ Normal – Has Published and Test
Systems o Via script or other method have games exit after 10 min's if there's been no key Input
 Stretch Goals/Interesting ideas • Consider a local Test Mode – Arcade Switches to AP mode
displays connection info (random password) and has a web server student can drop new game build
on and tests. The machine Would delete the game and reset after a period of time. o Security
would be a big consideration on this idea as it would be easy to abuse and not much in the way of
logging vs official upload via Git Hub. • Implement a voting system on the Arcade Machine to give
meaning to the star ranking. • Arcade Games – GitHub Actions o Correct C# for Arm (this should be
done; see trello card for Status) ▪ Dotnet does not run correctly in the Emulated PI environment
used for C++ games. New Action was created for compiling dotnet vs Arm games small bug in
checking logic to be fixed before merge. o Update Arcade – Games Readme ▪ Updated Controle to
correctly reflect the Arcade machine ▪ Updated on new Compiling Process ▪ Instruct that All
Game Assets must go into the Resources Folder (Action does try to capture root directories like
images, sound, etc.) This includes level maps etc., or they won't upload to Arcade Machines o
Implement Versioning for compiled games. ▪ A simple version file in the games directory receives
an incremental bump every time the game is updated so the Arcade knows to get the latest version.
▪ This file can also contain additional information for the Arcade Menu. (Author, Publisher,
other) o Retrieve and Compile Games from SubModules o Formalise Process with Deakin Staff on how
Students from Classes like SIT102 or SIT771 can upload games to the Arcade Machine ▪ Barrier
will be using GitHub for new students, especially as this will use submodules. ▪ Consider
creating scripts to automate the linking of sub-modules • Move All games to Sub-Modules 36 o
Games made by Toth-Tech should be moved to their own repo, (or we can consider a separate Company
if we don't want to crowd the Githubn too Much) o This will potentially allow Linking to Other
Student Repos. Splashkit Expansion • Priority Items Deployment Packages o Debian Package. o Nuget
Package. o Brew Package. • Check for Further Functions from Swin games to port into splashkit. •
Fix Python Compatbility o Python can no longer be used to code games with SplashKit. Previous
research indicates a change with v3.8; see here. • Look at Adding AI function to SplashKit o Can
look at LLMs like ChatGPT o Similar Functions to https: //scikit-learn.org/ • Dev Container Mac o
As most SplashKit Programs have a visual component and not browser-based based, we need a way to
view the program's window output. This is normally accomplished by xserver forwarding and sound
via pulse audio. o mac xquartz is a xserver compatible with Mac Instaitl Tests container that can
be setup and run x based programs e.g. xeyes but there is a compatibility issue with the graphics
system in SplashKit. Further investigation is needed. • SplashKit.io o Publish Astro Starlight
site ▪ The Aim will be to convert Splashkit.io to our new webpage platform ▪ Advise getting a
subdomain like new.splashkit.io (or similar) setup for testing, and Transition will just be a DNS
change then) o Thorough documentation of the new site is needed o The Existing SplashKit.io may
have a function to auto-update the API pages based on functions added to SplashKit. This should
be investigated and replicated in the new site. • Game Engine o Project Setup: Create a
streamlined project setup process for easier onboarding and development. o Camera System:
Implement a flexible and efficient camera system to handle different views and perspectives. o
Transforms: Develop a system for handling object transformations like translation, rotation, and
scaling. o Event System: Design an event system for handling game events in an extensible manner.
o Input Handling System: Implement a robust input handling system to manage user interactions. •
Documentation Migration 37 o As the company is moving to a new documentation repository a data
Migration will need to occur between the existing documentation repo and the new one. o Work with
company operations to plan the migration, but the SplashKit team needs to move the existing
document over (also consider it a good opportunity to clean house and archive older information)

8. Product - CourseFlow CourseFlow aims to assist students in planning and comprehending the
requirements and structuring of university courses. Users can generate and adjust their CourseMap
to account for changes. For instance, a student will be able to see their expected graduation
date or complications that may arise if they complete units in a particular order or study load.
Students are also able to use the ‘discovery’ page to find units or electives that are relevant
to their course, interests, and career goals. Units are represented as dots and units that are
more like each other or to a particular field such as law or art are grouped together. The
project overall aims to assist students in planning out how they will complete their course and
adjust for changes that will affect their course plan. 6.1. Team Members and Their Key

Finalised UI design on Figma o The Figma project has pages divided into finalised designs as well
as drafts. • Base implementation of the CourseMap page and dynamically displaying the core units
for a specific course (read from the json file) o There is a limit of 4 units displayed in each
row of a the ‘unit-container div’ This is since there is generally a maximum of 4 units per
trimester. o The ‘unit card’ for a unit can be clicked on. A dialog box will then open that
contains more information about the specific unit. • Web scraped data on courses and units have
been sectioned into relevant json files. o There is a file containing only Bachelor of Computer
Science units, a file with data for all units and a file for all courses. ▪ The course data
contains the core units for a course. The unit data contains the unit summary, prerequisites,
assessments, GLO’s and more. Deliverable Location At this stage, this current main implementation

Technical work by: Mark Enriquez Summary of Deliverables • Create a UI for the ‘Discovery’ view
page. • Base implementation of the ‘Discovery’ view page and visualising the data completed using
d3.js: o The graph-based map has been implemented which supports data (unit data for example)
with pre-calculated x and y positions. ▪ Pre-calculated x and y positions are done via
algorithms on the backend. o A text-based list which serves as an alternative to the graph-based
map is also implemented which supports this data. o Nodes on the graph are clickable which brings
up a detailed panel to show more information. ▪ Links to a node such as related units
(pre-requisites etc.) are available as buttons which can be clicked to bring up that node’s
information. ▪ Transition animation is also present from node to node. • Other implementations
of the Discovery Page is also available: o A force-directed, hierarchical based graph using
d3.js. o A force-directed graph using the ngx-graph library. Deliverable Location Main

thoth-tech/CourseFlow (github.com) Unit network layout algorithm Contributing Team Members Mel
Bugay Summary of Deliverables
Created a custom network layout algorithm to determine where units should be initially positioned
on the unit discovery webpage in Python. 44
The algorithm works by calculating the similarity between two units based on factors such as their
unit code, year level, and university faculty
The clustering-based variant of this algorithm uses DBSCAN to assign each unit to clusters based
on their similarity to each other, then calculates the layout of each cluster using the
Kamada-Kawai algorithm. The clusters are then combined together.
The stochastic gradient descent variant uses the Tensorflow and Keras libraries to create a neural
network that calculates the optimal positions of nodes.
The optimal x and y position of each node can be optimized using a custom loss function.
The SGD prototype was abandoned in favour of the clustering-based variant because the math
required to create a visually pleasing layout was too difficult for anyone in the team to
understand and work on. Deliverable Location Clustering based: Custom clustering-based network

6.3.Roadmap Course Map 45 • The user needs to be able to edit a specific year of their coursemap.
o The year ‘container’ should have an icon that the user can click that opens a small dialog box.
o From this the user would be able to change or alter the coursemap for that specific year. For
instance, the number of trimesters the user will study, The study load for the year etc • The user
needs to be able to edit a specific trimester of their coursemap. o The year ‘trimester’ should
have an icon that the user can click that opens a small dialog box. o From this the user would be
able to change or alter the coursemap for that specific trimester. For instance, the number of
units in the trimester the student will undertake. • There needs to be functionality that allows
users to add or edit a unit o For instance, a user can enter in a unit code to a specific
trimester. If the unit is able to be studied in that trimester and all prerequisite units will be
complete prior then the unit can be added into the trimester. • The ‘side menu’ has a variety of
sub sections such as ‘overview’ and ‘edit coursemap’. The contents of these sections need to be
expanded on o Discovery • Now that we have a base implementation, work can be done on optimizing
the graph. o Despite using pre-calculated positions, rendering over 3000 nodes/units is still
quite laggy. • We need to connect this to a backend endpoint. o At this stage, this is reading
data from a JSON file. • Width and height of the graph is fixed, and we need to introduce
responsiveness to different screen sizes. o This applies to the whole page in general and not just
the graph. o Will need to improve transition animations from node to node as it seems screen sizes
can impact this feature. • Some modifications to the front-end code might be required depending on
the layout algorithm on the backend. o The layout algorithm on the backend is still being worked
on and may impact the frontend. Analytics • An implementation of this component in Angular is
required. 46 o It may even be determined that this section isn’t required and can be added as a
sub-feature of the CourseMap page. Backend Measuring unit similarity based on its description
 Use an AI based approached to determine how similar two units are to each other based on their
description.
This would allow the unit discovery page to cluster units that are more similar to each other in a
way that is more meaningful.
Some proposed ways to achieve this include: o Using a bag-of-words approach. In this approach we
assume that units that are similar to each other will share keywords with each other. o Using
pre-trained word embeddings. This allows unit with descriptions that contain words that are
semantically similar to each other to be considered more similar to each other. o Using
pre-trained language models. Web-scrapers to get unit information directly from the university
site
The current unit data we have is outdated or incomplete, so it would be nice if we could update it
using a custom-built web-scraping tool that gathers unit data directly from the university’s
handbook webpage Docker • Enhance the Docker related files to incorporate the Backend once it is
ready. o The plan is to have two separate containers for the frontend and backend. 6.4. Open
Issues Technical issues
 We are still working on getting a reliable source of unit/course data through a combination of
web-scraping and using language models. The current source of this data is either given to us by
Deakin staff (which has limited information) or sourced ourselves from the 2019 university
handbook PDF file (which is unreliable)
 The layout of units as nodes on the discovery page is still a WIP. We created a somewhat working
layout algorithm but not completely satisfied with it yet.
Need to set up a CI/CD pipeline for the project once it matures some more. This includes setting
up a Docker network for the backend. (We have a docker image for developing the frontend but I’m
talking about making one for deploying CourseFlow) 47
Most of the code in the project lacks any form of automated testing.
Frontend webpages need to communicate with the backend to get unit information from the database
instead of hardcoding this information in the code or loading it from a JSON file. The webpages
currently load this information into the webpage through services in Angular, so we should be able
to easily replace these with new services that communicate with the backend.
The user authentication webpages aren’t communicating with the rest of the backend system at all,
they’re communicating directly with an online database hosted by Firebase. This part of the
authentication which belongs to the backend is written in Typescript instead of C# like the rest
of the backend. We need to rewrite the authentication webpages to bring user authentication under
the control of the backend system and address these two issues. Project issues
 Need to create streamlined instructions for setting up a development environment and contributing
to the project for future capstone members. Some work on this has already been done in the
project’s README.md and Contributing.md files in the project repository’s root folder.
There is a lot of work to be done on CourseFlow, however this trimester we had a lot of difficulty
in breaking down the tasks into smaller ones that could be distributed to team members.
Most members joining the project had very limited or no experience in using Git or GitHub. As
product leads, we were able to give them enough training to contribute code to the main repository
through pull requests, however the lack of experience limited members’ ability to directly
collaborate on code together. If they needed to collaborate on code, most members shared the code
by directly sending files to each other for most of the trimester. 6.5. Source Code GitHub

repository, we follow a structured branch management approach to ensure efficient and organized
development. Main Branch: The main branch within the CourseFlow repository holds stable versions
of the application. Access to this branch is restricted to repository maintainers and admins, and
contributors are required to submit pull requests (PRs) for changes. This strict control helps
maintain a reliable and deployable codebase. Development Branch: The development branch is where
ongoing work and new features are integrated. Contributors make PRs to this branch, and it
undergoes continuous integration and testing to ensure code quality. Contributors with maintainer
or admin permissions have the option to push minor commits directly to the development branch for
swift updates. Feature Branches: For specific tasks or features, contributors create feature
branches derived from the development branch. Feature branches isolate individual work, allowing
49 parallel development. Once a feature is complete, a PR is submitted to merge it back into the
development branch. This workflow keeps the development process organized and ensures that changes
are thoroughly reviewed before integration. Users with write permissions can push commits directly
to feature branches, but this practice is discouraged. It should only be employed for rapid
collaboration with other team members. Instead, we recommend contributors first push their changes
to a fork of CourseFlow and then create a PR to merge those changes into one of CourseFlow's
branches. File structure Files in the CourseFlow repository are separated into the Frontend,
Backend, or Documentation folders depending on their purpose. /Frontend: Contains code belonging
to CourseFlow’s website frontend, which are responsible for generating and displaying webpages
which the user directly interacts with. The main Angular application is contained within the
/Frontend/course-flow-app folder. Other Angular applications or webpages created in parallel are
contained within their respective folders in the /Frontend folder. /Backend: Contains code related
to CourseFlow’s website backend and data integration layer. The code in this directory is
responsible for storing and retrieving data, facilitating communication between the database and
frontend, gathering unit information, and storing them in the database. "MD033": {
"allowed\_elements": [ "ul", "li", "img" ] }, "MD013": { "tables": false }
