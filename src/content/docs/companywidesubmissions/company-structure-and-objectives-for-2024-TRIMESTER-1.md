### Project 3: Splash Kit

#### Splash Kit Overview, Goals, and Objectives

SplashKit is a simple-to-use programming framework specialising in 2D games to help teach students
introductory programming through the development of games. The framework is primarily coded in C++
but can be used in C++, C#, Python, Pascal, and more recently JavaScript.

#### Projects

- Arcade Machines: The university has purchased four Arcade machines that can be used to showcase
  games built-in SplashKit. The units run on a Rasberry Pi 3B+. Giving constraints and a target
  platform development. Our goal is to have this platform ready for students to show games developed
  using SplashKit by the Thoth Tech SplashKit team. In the long term, the aim is to have this
  platform available for first- year students with an easy-to-use process to upload their and test
  their games.
- SplashKit Website: The new SplashKit website, powered by the Starlight framework, represents a
  significant leap forward in providing an enriched and user-friendly experience for developers and
  learners alike. This gives us a platform to include the existing tutorials and guides linked to
  SplashKit.
- SplashKit Expansion: SplashKit framework was derived from a project called Swingame; in the
  original port, not all functions were moved across. The team will develop a roadmap reviewing what
  functions can be ported across and investigate new functions that can be added.
- SplashKit Online: A newer project where we give students access to an IDE in a web browser and the
  ability to run their code in a web browser. Kickstarted last trimester as prototype, we hope to
  develop it further.

#### Aims for Trimester

  are properly organized and copied to respective system folders when the package is added to a
  project.
- Restructure existing tutorials and guides to align with the updated SplashKit package, ensuring

  experience for developers.
- Establish a foundational structure for arcade game automation, providing a framework that
  simplifies future contributions from other developers. This includes setting up a clear directory
  structure and documentation.
- Implement showcase sliders on the SplashKit website, featuring visually engaging presentations of
  games developed with SplashKit. This will highlight the diversity and creativity of projects and
  attract new users to the platform.
