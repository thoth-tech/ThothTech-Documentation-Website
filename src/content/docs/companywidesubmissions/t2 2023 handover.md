of projects to enhance and upgrade this product that students can work on. CourseFlow is a Thoth
Tech product that was founded in T1 2023. It aims to assist students and course directors in course
planning and in comprehending the requirements of certain courses. It does this by giving users a
way to generate a personalized course map that meets the requirements of their course and by
providing a tool that allows users to view the requirements of all units (such as prerequisite
units) visually. SplashKit is currently a 2D game development Software Development Kit used to teach
object-oriented coding to beginners. It has been identified that SplashKit can be expanded to
explore other areas and languages. The Art Gallery Project is a new project that has been added in
T1 2023, it is a web-based API back end written in .NET 7 and C# on a PostgreSQL database and a Vue
front end that was developed by several students and a lecturer. The aim is to provide a system to

### Art Gallery

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives - Art Gallery

The Art Gallery is a product being created to help sell and advertise rural Art in Australia. We
made some good progress last trimester and have some amended goals this trimester to move the
product forward. The key focuses this trimester will be about getting the system deployed with a
working knowledge base. So future work on the system can be easier we will also look at implementing
a CI/CD pipeline.

### Projects - Art Gallery

This trimester we have a range of projects we are working on in the Art Gallery: Deployment – The
aim this trimester is to get the base product deployed after researching the various deployment
options (free tier). CI/CD Pipeline – We are also looking to investigate and implement a CI/Cd
pipeline for the product to make future development work easier and cleaner. Knowledge Base – A lot
of work has gone into designing and investigating the Knowledge base in Trimester 1 and we want to
build this solution and populate it with the knowledge we already have. IIIF Research – Art Gallery
need to adhere to specific standards and the format for the Art Gallery images should be IIIF, we
will be researching and writing a report on the requirements to meet this standard. Lighthouse
implementations – Last trimester we ran a project to test the system with Google Light house, the
report outlined some of the areas we needed to improve, and we hope to make those changes this
trimester. Front end update – Parts of the Vue front end are written in pure HTML/CSS, this need
updating to make use of the Vue framework.

### Aims for Trimester - Art Gallery

Implement Knowledge base. Investigate and implement a CI/CD pipeline for the product. Implement
changes based on Light house report from T1. Compare existing tech stack to Angular/Rails IIIF
research and report for image standard Add additional testing (JavaScript testing)

### Deliverables - Art Gallery

Short Term Working Knowledge base with documentation uploaded Deployed system and Deployment process
documentation CI/CD pipeline documented and live. IIIF research report Lighthouse report suggested
changes. Front end conversion to Vue framework. Long Term Full implement IIIF standard Test Current
system against Angular/Rails build. Document the Knowledge base procedures and process for use.

### Courseflow

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives - Courseflow

This project aims to assists students and course directors in course planning and in comprehending
the requirements of certain courses. It does this by giving users a way to generate a personalized
course map that meets the requirements of their course and by providing a tool that allows users to
view the requirements of all units (such as prerequisite units) visually.

### Aims for Trimester - Courseflow

Our aim this trimester is to complete an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for CourseFlow and deploy it
to a server. To achieve this, we need to design and implement key components which are detailed
under the deliverables section. Once the MVP is developed, the next step is to deploy it to a
server, making it accessible to users. This involves setting up the server infrastructure,
configuring the necessary software dependencies, and ensuring a smooth deployment process.

### Deliverables - Courseflow

Frontend: Finalise the UI ‘CourseMap’ timetable generating page with TypeScript and Angular Connect
the ‘CourseMap’ page with the Deakin/student data API. Create a UI for the ‘Discovery’ view page.
Significant progress on the ‘Discovery’ view page and visualising the data. Backend: Get access to
Deakin’s unit and course data, either through the private API used by StudentConnect, web-scraping
the handbook site, or some other way. Create API endpoints in C#. Write unit tests for the main
software components. Miscellaneous: Build up clear documentation of how the front end and backend.
Implement a CI/CD pipeline. Deploy CourseFlow to a server. Potentially have user testing depending
on the progress of the project Documentation: Write README.md files for CourseFlow GitHub Ensure
GitHub and repository runs up to speed. Ensure proper naming conventions throughout the codebase.
Work with front-end and back-end to make diagrams and explanations of how the project works and
connects.

### Splash Kit

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives - Splash Kit

Splashkit is a simple-to-use programming framework specialising in 2D games to help teach students
introductory programming through the development of games. The framework is primarily coded in C++
but can be used for C++, C#, Python, and Pascal.

### Projects - Splash Kit

Arcade Machines: The university has purchased four Arcade machines that can be used to showcase
games built-in SplashKit. The units run on a Rasberry Pi 3B+. Giving constraints and a target
platform development. Our goal is to have this platform ready for students to show games developed
using SplashKit by the Thoth Tech Splashkit team. In the long term, the aim is to have this platform
available for first-year students with an easy-to-use process to upload their and test their games.
Tutorials: As Splashkit is not a mainstream framework, there are fewer examples on how to use it
effectively available online. Our aim is to create a small series of tutorials using game
construction as the medium to convey how to use various SplashKit functions together. SplashKit
Expansion: Splashkit framework was derived from a project called Swingame; in the original port, not
all functions were moved across. The team will develop a roadmap reviewing what functions can be
ported across and investigate new functions that can be added. SplashKit Online: A new project we
wish to launch is SplashKit Online; the concept is to give students access to an IDE in a web
browser and the ability to run their code in a web browser.

### Aims for Trimester - Splash Kit

This trimester's primary goal is to prepare the arcade machines for the Burwood open day, displaying
students' work with playable demos. Create at least two tutorials, showing how to use sprites and
object interaction effectively. these areas will likely also be covered in the process of building
an interactive game – Handel Inputs, Draw to window, Animations, Collision detection. The team will
review what functions can be ported, develop a roadmap create processes for contributing to
Splashkit Framework, and investigate & manage bug reports. Investigate and produce initial designs
for how SplashKit Online can work.

### Deliverables - Splash Kit
