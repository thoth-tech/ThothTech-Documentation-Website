cd my-astro-site
```

### 2. Launch a Git Repository

Create a Git repository from scratch if you haven't before.

```shell
git init
```

### 3. Create a Repisitory on GitHub

Make a new repository using any Git hosting provider, such as GitHub. Insert the remote origin into
your repository locally

```shell
git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
```

git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Set up Netlify

- "Click on "New site from Git" on the Netlify dashboard.

- Connect your Github repository.

### 6. Deploy the Site

- Press "Deploy site" to begin the building process.

Automatic deployments are offered by Netlify anytime you push updates to your linked Git repository.
A fresh deployment is initiated with every push to the main branch.

Well done! On Netlify, your Astro website is now active. If you have set up a custom domain, you can
use it to access it instead of the Netlify domain that is provided. Every time you push changes to
your repository, Netlify will take care of the build and deployment procedure automatically.
