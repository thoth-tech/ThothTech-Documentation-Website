## Introduction

---

This document will provide an overview of the backend requirements of CourseFlow within OnTrack.
There will be some cross-over of information with other documentation such as the
enhanced-erd-and-data-modelling document and the software design document.

## Course Map

---

### Routes

Upon entry to the CourseFlow system within OnTrack, the course map associated with the authenticated
user will need to be fetched or created.

As such, the backend needs to have the following routes to cater for this:

| Endpoint                      | Description                                | Request Body | Response Body |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /coursemap/userId         | Get a user's course map via their userId.  | None         | CourseMap     |
| GET /coursemap/courseId       | Get all course maps via the course id.     | None         | CourseMap[]   |
| POST /coursemap               | Add a new course map for a user.           | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| PUT /coursemap/coursemapId    | Updates an existing course map via its id. | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| DELETE /coursemap/coursemapId | Deletes an existing course map via its id. | None         | None          |

To further elaborate on each route:

**GET /coursemap/userId**

We need a route to get a course map associated with a user - we can do this via the user id.

**GET /coursemap/courseId**

This specific route is mostly going to be for templates of a course map. Essentially, if we cannot
find a course map for a user, we will need to trigger a response to add a new course map. Once we
have the associated course for the student (obtained via mechanisms described below), we can use the
course id to fetch all course maps with that id that do not have a user id which will be implied to
be templates (with pre-set course map units at the proper positions).

As mentioned but worth repeating, for this to work properly, this has to only include course map
data without a user id (we do not want to fetch course maps belonging to other students). When a
template is chosen, we will create a duplicate of the associated data to be added as new entries for
both the course map (with the associated user id this time) and the course map units.

**POST /coursemap**

We need to have a way to create a new course map for the user (or a template course map). The client
side interface presenting a list of courses or mechanism connecting with a student's enrollment will
be required to associate the course map with a specific course.

**PUT /coursemap/coursemapId**

Technically speaking, there shouldn't be a need to update the course map entry itself since we can
make direct updates to the course map unit entries. However, the route will be included in case it
is ever needed.

**DELETE /coursemap/coursemapId**

We need a way to delete a course map. This will also require all course map units associated with
this course map to be deleted as well.

### Model

The model for the course map will be as follows:

| Field       | Type    | Description                               |
| ----------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| courseMapId | Integer | Auto generated id.                        |
| userId      | Integer | OnTrack user id.                          |
| courseId    | Integer | Course id associated with this course map |
| dateAdded   | Date    | Date this entry was added.                |
| dateUpdated | Date    | Date this entry was updated.              |

The main thing to note regarding this model is the course id which will need to be obtained before
creating a new course map entry. This will be utilized to fetch information about the course such as
requirements etc. For the purposes of this model and the associated POST route, the mechanism in
getting the associated course itself is not important (as this will be handled separately). The
options at present involves:

- Getting student enrolment information via an API to Deakin University's systems.
- Importing student enrolment information.
- Manually setting the course via a client side user interface (will be an input box resulting in
  best matching courses based on search query).
- Associating a course upon creation of the user and have the course map created at this point in
  time.

This aspect of CourseFlow will require further discussions before more details can be documented
here.

## Course Map Unit

---

### Routes

This has a strong association with the course map and upon entry into the CourseFlow system, once we
have the course map associated with the user fetched, we can use the course map id to fetch all
course map units that belongs to the specific course map.

| Endpoint                              | Description                                                    | Request Body  | Response Body   |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| GET /coursemapunit/courseMapId        | Get a all course map units associated with the course map id.  | None          | CourseMapUnit[] |
| POST /coursemapunit                   | Add a new course map unit for a user.                          | CourseMapUnit | CourseMapUnit   |
| PUT /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId    | Updates an existing course map unit via its id.                | CourseMapUnit | CourseMapUnit   |
| DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId | Deletes an existing course map unit via its id.                | None          | None            |
| DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapId     | Deletes all course map units via the associated course map id. | None          | None            |

To further elaborate on each route:

**GET /coursemapunit/courseMapId**

Here, we use the course map id to fetch all course map units associated with that id. This will
essentially retrieve user/student specific set course map units.

An alternative to having this handled as a separate route is potentially a join operation when
fetching the course map. In this situation, we combine the course map units together with the course
map data in the request body.

**POST /coursemapunit**

This is needed to add new course map units for a specific course map.

Please note that for this to be correct, we will not only need to associate this with a course map,
but also to specific instance of a unit (a unit version that belongs to a specific year and teaching
period etc.). This is achievable through the client side processes when dragging and dropping (or
selecting) a unit into the respective slot where the unit Id will be available at that point in
time.

**PUT /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId**

This allows for updating a course map unit. The main use case for this is when a user is moving a
unit around within the course map or performing a swap with another unit. Here, we can make direct
calls to this route and update the data with new positional information (slot positions for year
etc.).

**DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapUnitId**

A simple delete route where we can delete a course map unit via its id. There will be an option
available on the client side to delete course map units from the course map.

**DELETE /coursemapunit/courseMapId**

This extra delete route will allow for deleting of all course map units based on the course map id.
This will be useful when deleting the course map which will also require a delete of all course map
units.

It is worth mentioning that there might be functionality with regards to Ruby on Rails that can
delete all course map units once the course map has been deleted. If this is the case, this route
will be redundant and we only need the delete route for the course map.

### Model

The model for the course map unit will be as follows:

| Field              | Type    | Description                  |
| ------------------ | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| courseMapUnitId    | Integer | Auto generated id.           |
| courseMapId        | Integer | Associated course map id.    |
| unitId             | Integer | Associated unit id.          |
| yearSlot           | Integer | Year slot.                   |
| teachingPeriodSlot | Integer | Teaching period slot.        |
| unitSlot           | Integer | Unit slot.                   |
| createdAt          | Date    | Date this entry was added.   |
| updatedAt          | Date    | Date this entry was updated. |

So, the key factors here are:

- Course map id which will associate a specific course map to the respective course map units.
- Unit id which will associate the course map unit with a unit. This in itself will allow obtaining
  of unit information such as name, unit code, handbook url and requirements etc.
- All three slot fields and their respective values will allow for matching to the correct spot on
  the client side visuals. For example:
  - If we have 2021 as a year slot value, the unit will go to the 2021 container.
  - If teaching period slot is 1, the unit will go to the teaching period container inside the
    respective year container associated with that value (in the case of Deakin, this will be
    associated to the Trimester 1 slot).
  - If the unit slot is 4, this will go to the 4th unit slot within the respective teaching period
    container.

## Course

---

### Routes

The routes involved with this will be relatively straightforward.

| Endpoint                | Description                                         | Request Body | Response Body |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /course             | Get all course data.                                | None         | Course[]      |
| GET /course/courseId    | Get a course by id.                                 | None         | Course        |
| GET /course/search      | Get courses that partially match the search params. | None         | Course[]      |
| POST /course            | Add a new course.                                   | Course       | Course        |
| PUT /course/courseId    | Updates an existing course via its id.              | Course       | Course        |
| DELETE /course/courseId | Deletes an existing course via its id.              | None         | None          |

The table above covers the function of each route quite well and thus, further explanation for each
will be excluded here.

### Model

The Course model will be as follows:

| Field     | Type    | Description                  |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| courseId  | Integer | Auto generated id.           |
| name      | String  | Name of course.              |
| code      | String  | Course code.                 |
| year      | Integer | Respective year of course.   |
| version   | String  | Course version number.       |
| url       | String  | Link to the course webpage.  |
| createdAt | Date    | Date this entry was added.   |
| updatedAt | Date    | Date this entry was updated. |

Here, the main thing worth mentioning is the year, version and url.

In terms of the year and version, this is the way the system keeps track of different versions of
courses. Technically speaking, a course would likely only have different versions on a per year
basis. However, to cater for the possibility that a course of a particular year gets updated, it
would be a good idea to keep a history of this. The course map will keep track of a specific entry
of a Course which will allow students to load up the correct version of the course (which by
extension, will allow loading of the correct course requirements which will also be tied to specific
course versions).

The url will link to the course page which will provide more information about the course (that
don't need to be present in CourseFlow such as contacts and entry requirements etc.). This can
either be presented on the client side as a simple link or used to embed the course page within an
IFrame element.

## Unit

---

### Routes

| Endpoint            | Description                          | Request Body | Response Body |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /unit           | Get all units                        | None         | Unit[]        |
| GET /unit/unitId    | Get a unit by id.                    | None         | Unit          |
| GET /unit/search    | Get all units by search params       | None         | Unit[]        |
| POST /unit          | Add a new unit.                      | Unit         | Unit          |
| PUT /unit/uniteId   | Updates an existing unit via its id. | Unit         | Unit          |
| DELETE /unit/unitId | Deletes an existing unit via its id. | None         | None          |

With the exception of this route: "GET /unit/specializationId", all other routes can be explained by
the table above.

**GET /unit/specializationId**

The aim of this route is to cater for the functionality of returning a list of units based on search
criteria. The search criteria will at this point in time, consist of:

- specializations
- year
- level
- teaching period

In terms of year and level, these fields will be present within the Unit model and we can perform a
query to include data within the table that conforms to these criteria.

Searching for specializations will require additional considerations. The data modelling for this
consists of:

- Specializations
- UnitSpecializations
- Units

Firstly, we will have a specializations table (more details on routes and model later) which will
consist of a list of different specializations. The ids for these specializations are used in
conjunction with the unit id to create a unit specialization entry. In other words, within the
UnitSpecializations, we can have a single unit marked by the same unit id, appear multiple times,
each with different specialization ids. This will essentially create the list of specializations
associated with a specific version of a unit.

On the client side, we would have performed a fetch for all specializations to populate a drop down
menu or some kind of list where we can select the specializations we want to search for. The data
here will contain the specialization ids. As such, an approach for this searching functionality is
to include the list of specialization ids which can be used to query the UnitSpecializations table
to return back all unit ids which match the specialization ids.

The teaching period search will follow a similar process where teaching periods will be loaded on
the client side with their ids. Upon selection, we can use the ids and search the Units table for
all units that match the teaching period ids.

Ultimately, the end result will be a list of units that need to take into consideration all of the
search parameters and include/exclude units accordingly.

### Model

The model will be as follows:

| Field            | Type    | Description                                                    |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| unitId           | Integer | Auto generated id.                                             |
| unitOfferingId   | Integer | Unit offering id.                                              |
| year             | Integer | Respective year of unit.                                       |
| version          | String  | Unit version number.                                           |
| level            | Integer | Unit level.                                                    |
| teachingPeriodId | Integer | Id of the teaching period for this specific entry of the unit. |
| url              | String  | Link to the unit webpage.                                      |
| createdAt        | Date    | Date this entry was added.                                     |
| updatedAt        | Date    | Date this entry was updated.                                   |

The main thing to note here is that each entry of the unit needs to keep track of the Unit Offering
that it will be based off. Other fields are explained within the description of the table above.

This unit will form the basis of the course map unit which will contain specific course map related
properties.

## Specialization

---

### Routes

This will be relatively straightforward. We simply need routes that can get/add/update/delete
specializations.

| Endpoint                                | Description                                    | Request Body   | Response Body    |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| GET /specialization                     | Get all specializations.                       | None           | Specialization[] |
| GET /specialization/specializationId    | Get specialization by id.                      | None           | Specialization   |
| POST /specialization                    | Add a new specialization.                      | Specialization | Specialization   |
| PUT /specialization/specializationId    | Updates an existing specialization via its id. | Specialization | Specialization   |
| DELETE /specialization/specializationId | Deletes an existing specialization via its id. | None           | None             |

### Model

The model will be as follows:

| Field            | Type    | Description                  |
| ---------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| specializationId | Integer | Auto generated id.           |
| specialization   | String  | Specialization name.         |
| createdAt        | Date    | Date this entry was added.   |
| updatedAt        | Date    | Date this entry was updated. |

## Teaching Period

---

### Routes

This will also be relatively straightforward. We simply need routes that can get/add/update/delete
teaching periods.

| Endpoint                                | Description                                     | Request Body   | Response Body    |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| GET /teachingperiod                     | Get all teaching periods.                       | None           | TeachingPeriod[] |
| GET /teachingperiod/teachingperiodId    | Get teaching period via its id.                 | None           | TeachingPeriod   |
| POST /teachingperiod                    | Add a new teaching period.                      | TeachingPeriod | TeachingPeriod   |
| PUT /teachingperiod/teachingperiodId    | Updates an existing teaching period via its id. | TeachingPeriod | TeachingPeriod   |
| DELETE /teachingperiod/teachingperiodId | Deletes an existing teaching period via its id. | None           | None             |

### Model

The model will be as follows:

| Field               | Type    | Description                  |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| teachingPeriodId    | Integer | Auto generated id.           |
| teachingPeriodLabel | String  | Name of the teaching period. |
| year                | Integer | Year of the teaching period. |
| teachingStart       | Date    | Teaching start date.         |
| teachingEnd         | Date    | Teaching end date.           |
| createdAt           | Date    | Date this entry was added.   |
| updatedAt           | Date    | Date this entry was updated. |

The main thing to note here is that having this model lets us associate units to a specific teaching
period of a particular year.

## Requirements

---

### Routes

The core factor with the Requirement routes is the ability to fetch requirements based on the unitId
or courseId.

| Endpoint                          | Description                                 | Request Body | Response Body |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /requirement/                 | Get all requirements.                       | None         | Requirement[] |
| GET /requirement/unitId           | Get all requirements for a given unit id.   | None         | Requirement[] |
| GET /requirement/courseId         | Get all requirements for a given course id  | None         | Requirement[] |
| POST /requirement                 | Add a new requirement.                      | Requirement  | Requirement   |
| PUT /requirement/requirementId    | Updates an existing requirement via its id. | Requirement  | Requirement   |
| DELETE /requirement/requirementId | Deletes an existing requirement via its id. | None         | None          |

**GET /requirement/unitId and GET /requirement/courseId**

Basically, when we obtain the course data when loading up CourseFlow upon user entry or when loading
up a specific unit's data, we need to obtain their respective requirements.

This is achievable by using the unitId or courseId and fetching all the requirements in this manner.
Each requirement will then chain into the respective requirement set through separate requests (or
through a join operation to retrieve the requirement set together with the requirement itself) which
will contain more information such as the required list of units to complete.

**POST /requirement**

Adding requirements can be done in the respective sections where we can add new courses or new
units.

Since some courses (and perhaps some units) can share similar requirements such as the same major
and minor sequences, it would be worthwhile to include within the interface, a drop down list of
pre-set requirements. In a similar fashion to the course map templates mentioned earlier, we can
make use of empty unit and course id entries as a mechanism to indicate that it is a template
requirement. We can then create an entry based on the template and have the course or unit id added
on to the data.

### Model

The model of this will be as follows:

| Field                 | Type    | Description                                          |
| --------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| requirementsId        | Integer | Auto generated id.                                   |
| unitId                | Integer | Associated unit id.                                  |
| courseId              | Integer | Associated course id.                                |
| type                  | String  | The requirement type (count, minimum constrain etc.) |
| category              | String  | Category of the requirement (pre-requisite etc.)     |
| description           | String  | A description of what this requirement is.           |
| minimum               | Integer | The minimum number of units to complete.             |
| maximum               | Integer | The maximum number of units to complete.             |
| requirementSetGroupId | Integer | Id of the associated requirement group set.          |
| createdAt             | Date    | Date this entry was added.                           |
| updatedAt             | Date    | Date this entry was updated.                         |

This model has a few key factors to consider.

As mentioned, the unit and course id will be how we associate each requirement to the respective
instance/entry of a unit or course.

The type is an indicator of what type of requirement we are dealing with. We can use the type within
the client side code to influence the type of checking that needs to be done to update the visuals.
For example, if we have a Count type where the requirement is completion of Introduction to
Programming:

- We can set the minimum to 1 and have the requirement set contain the specific unit which the
  client side will check against with the course map to see if the unit has been set before the unit
  that requires it.
- We can also break down the count type to MinimumCount and do the same thing if more specificity is
  required in the logic handling in the front-end.

Category and description will be utilized by the client side to provide headings and information
respectively.

Minimum and maximum will be used in conjunction with the type where logic on the client side will
utilize to see if requirements have been met.

The requirement set group id will be used to fetch all of the entries in the respective table. The
purpose of this is to get back either a list of units or requirement ids which will be used to chain
requirements (further information for this provided in the Enhanced erd and data modelling
document).

It is worth pointing out that at this point in time, the current progress of a student in achieving
the requirement (complete 5 out of 21 units for example) will not be recorded in the database. The
primary aim is to have the client side utilize the requirement data in conjunction with the units
set on the course map (and potentially units marked as complete) to provide visual indicators on the
client side to show requirement progression.

## RequirementsSet

### Routes

This particular entity works in conjunction with Requirements where this provides a mechanism to
list out required units that belong to a requirement. Additionally, this also provides a way to
chain requirements to handle requirement choices. The routes will be as follow:

| Endpoint                                  | Description                                     | Request Body | Response Body    |
| ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| GET /requirementset/                      | Get all requirement sets.                       | None         | RequirementSet[] |
| GET /requirementset/requirementSetGroupId | Get all requirements set for a given group id.  | None         | RequirementSet[] |
| POST /requirementset                      | Add a new requirement set.                      | Requirement  | RequirementSet   |
| PUT /requirementset/requirementSetId      | Updates an existing requirement set via its id. | Requirement  | RequirementSet   |
| DELETE /requirementset/requirementSetId   | Deletes an existing requirement set via its id. | None         | None             |

**GET /requirementset/requirementSetGroupId **

The only route worth elaborating on is this route where we obtain requirement set entries based on
the group id. Here, we use the group id recorded with a requirement to find all entries associated
with this id.

For example, if a unit has 2 pre-requisites as a minimum count requirement, the entries of this
table associated with this requirement will have 2 entries with the same group id. Each entry will
reference the respective unit id.

### Model

The model will be as follows:

| Field                 | Type    | Description                                                       |
| --------------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| requirementSetId      | Integer | Auto generated id.                                                |
| requirementSetGroupId | Integer | Associated requirement set group id.                              |
| description           | String  | Description/message of the requirement set if needed.             |
| unitId                | Integer | Id of the associated unit.                                        |
| requirementId         | Integer | Id of a chained requirement associated with this requirement set. |
| createdAt             | Date    | Date this entry was added.                                        |
| updatedAt             | Date    | Date this entry was updated.                                      |

Most of the explanations regarding how this model will work has already been mentioned. Just to
further emphasize the point, each instance of this entity will be associated to a requirement and it
will be our way of tracking a list of units associated with a requirement or chaining to another
requirement to essentially create a group of selectable requirements.
