## 1 - Introduction

---

CourseFlow is a clear and easy-to-use course planning platform that helps students navigate through
their course requirements and graduate with confidence.

This product was initially a RapidX project founded in Trimester 1, 2023 by:

- Mel David Bugay
- Kieron Anthony Boyle
- Ted Wang

To fully realize this project into a working minimum viable product, this document will utilize
previously established foundational work from diagrams, proof of concepts and prototypes to provide
these key coverage points:

- A clear outline of the problem to be solved.
- A proposed solution.
- A high level overview of requirements in relation to the problem.
- A detailed break-down of key components of the overall system.

### 1.1 - Problem Definition

At Deakin University, a large repertoire of courses are available for potential students to enrol in
to help shape their future career goals. Each of these courses will have a set of requirements
ranging from minimum credit points achieved, completion of core units and completion of minor/major
sequences with required units etc. Additionally, the units themselves can also have certain
requirements/restrictions such as pre-requisites, co-requisites and minimum number of units
completed etc.

These course and unit requirements can prove to be a challenge to keep track off and manage for some
students. As such, there is a need for a tool that can help students plan their course and help them
manage their course and unit requirements. Ultimately, this allows them to have a seamless
experience with their degree where requirements can easily be managed so that they can focus on
their studies and achieve their goals.

### 1.2 - Solution

CourseFlow aims to be a solution to the above defined problem where it will provide as easy-to-use
interface for students to plan their degree and be capable of considering course and unit
requirements.

### 1.2 - Target Audience

Students who struggle to or simply desire to keep track of and manage their course and unit
requirements.

### 1.3 - Intended Use

To be used by students studying at Deakin University for the purposes of course planning and
tracking.

### 1.4 - Scope

A working MVP that aims to have:

- A functioning editable and saveable course map for each year and trimester.
- Requirements for courses and units defined and displayed.
- Requirements not being met indicated to the user.
- Query system for course and unit selection based on criteria such as interest area etc.

## 2 - High-Level Overview and Requirements

---

This section will provide a high-level overview and key requirements of the product.

### 2.1 - User Stories

| User Stories                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| As a student, I want to have my course requirements clearly defined and presented to me so that I know what I need to complete my degree and thus, plan accordingly.                                                                  |
| As a student, I want to have unit requirements to be clearly defined and presented to me so that I know if I can take a unit or not.                                                                                                  |
| As a student, I want to be able to plan ahead for my course and map out all of my units so that I can ensure all requirements of my degree are met.                                                                                   |
| As a student, I want to be able to have flexibility in the number units and trimesters I take part in so that I can allow flexibility in my course due to being a part-time student or for general flexibility due to my commitments. |
| As a student, I want courses and units presented to me to be groupable by categories so that I can easily filter through units based on my selection criteria.                                                                        |
| As a student, I want to be able to choose a course or unit based on my interest area so that I can study in areas I have interest in and would like to work in.                                                                       |

### 2.2 - High-Level Requirements

This application requires the following:

- A selection interface for students to select the course they are studying or want to study with a
  query system to filter out courses based on factors such as interest area.
- Have course requirements clearly presented to the user with completion indication based on the
  current course map.
- An interface for students to be able to add/update/remove units, trimesters and years in their
  course map. with indications for requirements being met or not.
- A system for selection of units with a query system to filter out units based on factors such as
  interest area. to filter units based on user selection criteria either through drop down
  selections or a series of questions.
- Core units for the course and units belonging to a major/minor sequence needs to be easily
  accessible to the user.
- Have the course map state saved at all times.

### 2.3 - Assumptions

At this stage, the key assumption will be that there will be no or limited access to Deakin
University’s API to get course and unit information.

Additionally, as an extension to that, it will be assumed that there will be no or limited access to
student information, including their enrolment information and their unit status.

These assumptions are subject to change as the project progresses and will be reviewed again at a
later date and updated in this document accordingly.

## 4 - Detailed System Design

---

This section will provide in depth detail of the CourseFlow system with respect to the Frontend and
the Backend components.

### 4.1 - Technology Stack

**Front-End**: Angular

**Back-End**: Ruby on Rails

**Database**: MongoDB

### 4.2 - Features with Functional Requirements

This section will provide more detail on the requirements listed earlier as clear features. This will also provide context to the backend APIs that need to be defined and what their role will be in supporting these features.

**Editable Course Map**

- The initial presentation of the course map will be based on course selection.
- Course requirements, along with progression to completing said requirements will need to be clearly presented to the user.
  - This will be achieved by comparing the current set units in the course map against the course requirements.
- The exact state of the course map in terms of unit placement in a specific year and trimester container needs to be saved at all times.

**Course Selection**

- This will be presented to the user if the user is not associated with a course map or if they want to change their course choice.
- A query system will need to be implemented where either drop down menus or a series of questions will be presented to the user to gauge what their interest areas are (and other forms of categorization of courses and units).
  - As such, courses and units will be associated with categories to support this system.
  - For the purposes of the MVP, this will be manually set. Future iterations of this application can explore the use of Machine Learning to categorize units and courses based on their textual description.
  - Queries will be used to get back course data with the respective matching selection criteria.
- Course requirements will need to be a part of the course data that is requests from the client side.

**Unit Selection**

- There are two key parts to this feature:
  - Core units of any kind will be shown to the user in an easy to access manner. This can be through a course based template or through a window with course units already present and ready to be drag and dropped.
  - Electives will have a separate interface and much like the course, will also need a query system to filter units based on user criteria such as interest area.
- In both of the above mentioned key parts, units will need to have a clear indicator if they will be valid for selection based on the current course map settings.
  - This is not a restriction in placing a unit and just a visual indicator so that users are aware they do not meet the requirements with their current settings.
- To cater for units being removed from the map (making some units potentially invalid) and to allow users to set a unit regardless of validity, the unit display on the course map needs to have a visual indicator to inform the user of invalid units.
- A panel is required to display a unit's requirements and the progression to meeting those requirements upon clicking on the respective UI element (button etc.).

**Requirements Indicators**

- This has already been mentioned in the previous features but worth adding as a feature of CourseFlow as it forms an integral part of this application.
- Course requirements with the current progress needs to be displayed in an interface.
- Unit requirements such as pre-requisites etc. needs an interface to be displayed with current progress to meeting those requirements where applicable (completing 2 SIT coded units for example).
- To accommodate for these requirements, course and unit data will need to contain their respective requirements and compared to the current course map settings to update the appropriate visuals.

### 4.3 - Bounded Contexts

There will be 4 major bounded contexts that need to be defined in this API:

- Course Map
- Course
- Unit
- User

**Course Map**

The handling of the course map context contributes to the key function of CourseFlow which is to
allow a student to plan their course. Through the units being set into the course map, a student will then be able to see if requirements for the course and unit are being met.

As such, the key requirements for this context will be the following:

- It needs to be able to save the state of the course map exactly as the user has set on the client side.
- It needs to be able to add/update/remove units, trimesters and years.

There are a few approaches to handle this requirement. 

The following data structures are required as a minimum:

```js
// CourseMap Schema
{
  courseMapId: Integer,
  studentId: Integer,
  units: CourseMapUnit[]
}

// CourseMapUnit Schema
{
  courseMapUnitId: Integer,
  unitId: Integer,
  yearContainer: String,
  trimesterContainer: String
}
```

** Requirements **

The requirements data forms a crucial aspect of this application as it defines
requirements/constraints for courses and units that will be utilized to indicate to the user if
their course map is valid or not.

**Course**

Course data formulates an important aspect of this application for the following reasons:

- Students need to select a course from a list of courses (ideally categorized properties such as
  discipline area or school).
- The course map will need a course to be set in order to display the correct information in
  relation to course requirements.

To accommodate for this, endpoints in the API need to be defined based on the following criteria:

- Need to be able to get a list of course data.
- Need to be able to get a list of course data based on a selection criteria.
- Need to be able to get a specific course by its ID.
- Need to be able to add a new course.
- Need to be able to update an existing course.
- Need to be able to delete an existing course.

The data associated with courses in the context of CourseFlow will have some minimum requirements
that will be needed so that it can be presented to the user on the client side.

Most importantly, course requirements (such as minimum credit points, core units etc.) will also
need to be captured in each course.

As such, the general schema for the course context will be as follows:

| Field        | Type           | Description                                              |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| id           | String         | MongoDB auto generated id.                               |
| name         | String         | Name of course.                                          |
| description  | String         | Description of the course.                               |
| year         | Integer        | Respective year of course.                               |
| categories   | String[]       | A list of string based categories to help group courses. |
| requirements | Requirements[] | A list of requirements for the course.                   |
| dateAdded    | Date           | Date this entry was added.                               |
| dateUpdated  | Date           | Date this entry was updated.                             |

**Unit**

Similar to the course data, unit data will also be important for course map planning and ensuring
unit requirements are correctly presented to students.

The requirements are as follows:

- Need to be able to get a list of all unit data.
- Need to be able to filter and get a list of unit data based on user selected criteria.
- Need to be able to get a unit data by its id.
- Need to be able to add a new unit
- Need to be able to update a unit.
- Need to be able to delete a unit.

Much like the course data, an important aspect of the data that needs to be captured by the unit is
the requirements. Requirements can include specific pre-requisite units, co-requisite units and
minimum number of units belonging to a specific Deakin University school (SIT etc.) to be completed.

| Field        | Type           | Description                                            |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| id           | String         | MongoDB auto generated id.                             |
| name         | String         | Name of unt.                                           |
| description  | String         | Description of the unit.                               |
| year         | Integer        | Respective year of unit.                               |
| categories   | String[]       | A list of string based categories to help group units. |
| requirements | Requirements[] | A list of requirements for the unit.                   |
| dateAdded    | Date           | Date this entry was added.                             |
| dateUpdated  | Date           | Date this entry was updated.                           |

**User**

This will mainly be used to define users of the CourseFlow system, to fetch a user’s course map data
via their user id and will be needed for the authentication processes when introduced.

Here are the requirements:

- Need to be able to get a list of all user data.
- Need to be able to get a user data by username.
- Need to be able to add a new user.
- Need to be able to update a user.
- Need to be able to delete a user.

| Field       | Type   | Description                  |
| ----------- | ------ | ---------------------------- |
| id          | String | MongoDB auto generated id.   |
| userName    | String | User's username.             |
| password    | String | User's hashed password.      |
| name        | String | User's name.                 |
| dateAdded   | Date   | Date this entry was added.   |
| dateUpdated | Date   | Date this entry was updated. |
