## 1 - Introduction

---

CourseFlow is a clear and easy-to-use course planning platform that helps students navigate through
their course requirements and graduate with confidence.

This product was initially a RapidX project founded in Trimester 1, 2023 by:

- Mel David Bugay
- Kieron Anthony Boyle
- Ted Wang

To fully realize this project as a new feature of OnTrack, this document will utilize previously
established foundational work from diagrams, proof of concepts and prototypes to provide these key
coverage points:

- A clear outline of the problem to be solved.
- A proposed solution.
- A high level overview of requirements in relation to the problem.
- A detailed break-down of key components of the overall system.

### 1.1 - Problem Definition

At Deakin University, a large repertoire of courses are available for potential students to enrol in
to help shape their future career goals. Each of these courses will have a set of requirements
ranging from minimum credit points achieved, completion of core units and completion of minor/major
sequences with required units etc. Additionally, the units themselves can also have certain
requirements/restrictions such as pre-requisites, co-requisites and minimum number of units
completed etc.

These course and unit requirements can prove to be a challenge to keep track off and manage for some
students. As such, there is a need for a tool that can help students plan their course and help them
manage their course and unit requirements. Ultimately, this allows them to have a seamless
experience with their degree where requirements can easily be managed so that they can focus on
their studies and achieve their goals.

### 1.2 - Solution

CourseFlow aims to be a solution to the above defined problem where it will provide as easy-to-use
interface for students to plan their degree and be capable of considering course and unit
requirements.

### 1.3 - Target Audience

Students who struggle to or simply desire to keep track of and manage their course and unit
requirements.

### 1.4 - Intended Use

To be used by students studying at Deakin University for the purposes of course planning and
tracking.

### 1.5 - Scope

A working new feature that aims to have:

- A functioning editable and saveable course map for each year and trimester.
- Requirements for courses and units defined and displayed.
- Requirements not being met indicated to the user.
- Query system for course and unit selection based on interest area.

## 2 - High-Level Overview and Requirements

---

This section will provide a high-level overview and key requirements of the product.

### 2.1 - User Stories

| User Stories                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| As a student, I want to have my course requirements clearly defined and presented to me so that I know what I need to complete my degree and thus, plan accordingly.                                                                  |
| As a student, I want to have unit requirements to be clearly defined and presented to me so that I know if I can take a unit or not.                                                                                                  |
| As a student, I want to be able to plan ahead for my course and map out all of my units so that I can ensure all requirements of my degree are met.                                                                                   |
| As a student, I want to be able to have flexibility in the number units and trimesters I take part in so that I can allow flexibility in my course due to being a part-time student or for general flexibility due to my commitments. |
| As a student, I want to be able to choose a course or unit based on my interest area so that I can study in areas I have interest in and would like to work in.                                                                       |

### 2.2 - High-Level Requirements

This application requires the following:

- A selection interface for students to select the course they are studying or want to study with a
  query system to filter out courses based on interest area.
- Have course requirements clearly presented to the user with completion indication based on the
  current course map.
- An interface for students to be able to add/update/remove units, trimesters and years in their
  course map. with indications for requirements being met or not.
- A system for selection of units with a query system to filter out units based on interest area.
- Core units for the course needs to be easily accessible to the user.
- Have the course map state saved at all times.

### 2.3 - Assumptions

At this stage, the key assumption will be that there will be no or limited access to Deakin
Universityâ€™s API to get course and unit information.

Additionally, as an extension to that, it will be assumed that there will be no or limited access to
student information, including their enrolment information and their unit status.

These assumptions are subject to change as the project progresses and will be reviewed again at a
later date and updated in this document accordingly.

## 3 - System Architecture

### 3.2 - Data Flow Diagrams

The image shown below depicts the data flow between a student on the client side and the CourseFlow
system.

![CourseFlow DFD Level 0](/courseflow-dfd-level-0.png)

### 3.3 - Entity Relationship Diagram

The image below depicts an entity relationship diagram of the CourseFlow system. In addition to the
CourseFlow related data models and their relationships, existing OnTrack related data models has
also been included based on their relevancy to CourseFlow. To be more specific, the existing user
model will play a role within the context of CourseFlow where the user id will be used to associate
a user/student to a course map. In terms of the existing units model, since it already contains some
required data for the CourseFlow unit, a relationship was drawn between these two models to prevent
alteration of the existing table or doubling up on data.

## 4 - Detailed System Design

---

This section will provide in depth detail of the CourseFlow system with respect to the Frontend and
the Backend components. Since this project will be a part of OnTrack, references to existing systems
in OnTrack will be made where applicable.

### 4.2 - Feature Requirements

Features of CourseFlow will be described here in more detail. This will also provide context to the
backend API that will need to be defined and what their role will be in supporting these features.

**Editable Course Map**

- The initial presentation of the course map will be based on the course selected.
- Course requirements, along with progression to completing said requirements will need to be
  clearly presented to the user.
  - This will be achieved by comparing the current set units in the course map against the course
    requirements.
- Course map needs to be able to support units being dragged and dropped into slots.
  - Additionally, each unit that has been set needs to be able to be dragged and dropped into other
    slots or into other units which will trigger a swap between the unit positions.
- Need to be able to add/remove year containers, trimester contains and unit slot containers.
- The exact state of the course map in terms of unit placement in a specific year and trimester
  container needs to be saved at all times.
  - Containers being added don't need to be saved unless a unit has been placed inside it.
- To cater for units being removed from the map (making some units potentially invalid) and to allow
  users to set a unit regardless of validity, the unit display on the course map needs to have a
  visual indicator to inform the user of invalid units.
- A panel is required to display a unit's requirements and the progression to meeting those
  requirements upon clicking on the respective UI element (button etc.).

**Course Selection**

- This will be presented to the user if the user is not associated with a course map or if they want
  to change their course choice.
- A query system for categories (such as interests) will need to be implemented to help filter and
  narrow down courses (useful to narrow down courses by interest area instead of presenting all
  courses which will not be useful to a student).

**Unit Selection**

- There are two key parts to this feature:
  - Core units of any kind will be shown to the user in an easy to access manner. This will shown
    via a window/panel with core units already present and ready to be drag and dropped.
  - Electives will have a separate interface and much like the course, will also need a query system
    to filter units based on user criteria.
- In both of the above mentioned key parts, units will need to have a clear indicator if they will
  be valid for selection based on the current course map settings.
  - This is not a restriction in placing a unit and just a visual indicator so that users are aware
    they do not meet the requirements with their current settings.

**Requirements Indicators**

- Course requirements with the current progress needs to be displayed.
- Unit requirements such as pre-requisites etc. needs to be displayed with current progress to
  meeting those requirements where applicable (completing 2 SIT coded units for example).
- To accommodate for these requirements, course and unit data will need to be associated with set
  requirements and compared to the current course map settings to update the appropriate visuals.

### 4.3 - API and Data Requirements

**Course Map and Course Map Units**

The handling of the course map contributes to a key function of CourseFlow which is to allow a
student to plan their course. Through the units being set into the course map, a student will then
be able to see if requirements for the course and unit are being met.

From a data association perspective, a course map needs to have a few key requirements:

- Association with a user/student.
- Association with a course.
- Associations with course map units.

As described in the ERD diagram, the above requirements (in the respective order) can be achieved
by:

- Using the user model established by OnTrack to get a user id.
- Using the course flow course id to create the association to a course.
- Having a separate table of units associated to a specific course map via the course map id.

The full model of the course map will be as follows and will require handling between the course map
and course map units tables (this will be the data returned upon requesting for a course map).

| Field           | Type              | Description                  |
| --------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------- |
| courseMapId     | Integer           | Auto generated id.           |
| userId          | Integer           | OnTrack user id.             |
| courseFlowUnits | CourseFlowUnits[] | Array of course flow units.  |
| dateAdded       | Date              | Date this entry was added.   |
| dateUpdated     | Date              | Date this entry was updated. |

In terms of the required endpoints, the course map will need the following:

| Endpoint                      | Description                                | Request Body | Response Body |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /coursemap/userId         | Get a user's course map via their userId.  | None         | CourseMap     |
| POST /coursemap               | Add a new course map for a user.           | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| PUT /coursemap/coursemapId    | Updates an existing course map via its id. | CourseMap    | CourseMap     |
| DELETE /coursemap/coursemapId | Deletes an existing course map via its id. | None         | None          |

A few notes regarding these endpoints:

- An authenticated user of OnTrack can use their id to fetch a course map.
- If a course map doesn't exist, they will be able to add a new course map with an association to a
  chosen course.
- The update request will allow for updating of the associated course upon course selection changes.

As for the course map unit, the endpoints described below will be required.

| Endpoint                           | Description                                                   | Request Body  | Response Body   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| GET /coursemapunit/courseMapId     | Get a all course map units associated with the course map id. | None          | CourseMapUnit[] |
| POST /coursemapunit                | Add a new course map unit for a user.                         | CourseMapUnit | CourseMapUnit   |
| PUT /coursemapunit/coursemapunitId | Updates an existing course map unit via its id.               | CourseMapUnit | CourseMapUnit   |
| DELETE /coursemapunit/coursemapId  | Deletes an existing course map unit via its id.               | None          | None            |

The justification for this extra table dedicated to course map units is to follow a similar
structure to OnTrack and also, additions/updates/deletions to a course map unit can be easily made
via these routes.

**CourseFlow Course**

For students to be able to track their course requirements and progression, course information will
be required.

The full course data will be as follow:

| Field        | Type           | Description                                 |
| ------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| courseId     | Integer        | Auto generated id.                          |
| name         | String         | Name of course.                             |
| description  | String         | Description of the course.                  |
| year         | Integer        | Respective year of course.                  |
| categories   | Categories[]   | A list of categories to help group courses. |
| requirements | Requirements[] | A list of requirements for the course.      |
| dateAdded    | Date           | Date this entry was added.                  |
| dateUpdated  | Date           | Date this entry was updated.                |

The above model will require data handling between the CourseFlow course, requirements and
categories table.

The following endpoints will be required.

| Endpoint                           | Description                                                | Request Body | Response Body |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| GET /courseflowcourses             | Get all course data.                                       | None         | Course[]      |
| GET /courseflowcourses/courseId    | Get a course by id.                                        | None         | Course        |
| GET /courseflowcourses/categories  | Get all course data that match with the categories params. | None         | Course[]      |
| POST /courseflowcourses            | Add a new course.                                          | Course       | Course        |
| PUT /courseflowcourses/courseId    | Updates an existing course via its id.                     | Course       | Course        |
| DELETE /courseflowcourses/courseId | Deletes an existing course via its id.                     | None         | None          |

In terms of addition/update/deletion of course data, the administration panel for admin users of
OnTrack can be utilized with a new option for courses.

**Unit**

Units will play a key role in building a student's course map and also providing requirement
information to ensure student's are eligible to take a unit.

The full course flow unit data (utilizing associations with multiple tables as described in the ERD)
will be as follows.

| Field        | Type           | Description                              |
| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| unitId       | Integer        | Auto generated id.                       |
| unitCode     | String         | Unit code.                               |
| name         | String         | Name of unt.                             |
| description  | String         | Description of the unit.                 |
| year         | Integer        | Respective year of unit.                 |
| level        | Integer        | Respective level of unit.                |
| categories   | Categories[]   | A list of interests to help group units. |
| requirements | Requirements[] | A list of requirements for the unit.     |
| dateAdded    | Date           | Date this entry was added.               |
| dateUpdated  | Date           | Date this entry was updated.             |

The endpoints that are required:

| Endpoint                                 | Description                                                         | Request Body   | Response Body    |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| GET /courseflowunits                     | Get all course flow unit data.                                      | None           | CourseFlowUnit[] |
| GET /courseflowunits/courseflowUnitId    | Get course fow unit by id.                                          | None           | CourseFlowUnit   |
| GET /courseflowunits/categories          | Get all course flow unit data that match with the categories param. | None           | CourseFlowUnit[] |
| POST /courseflowunits                    | Add a new course flow unit.                                         | CourseFlowUnit | CourseFlowUnit   |
| PUT /courseflowunits/courseflowUnitId    | Updates an existing course flow unit via its id.                    | CourseFlowUnit | CourseFlowUnit   |
| DELETE /courseflowunits/courseflowUnitId | Deletes an existing course flow unit via its id.                    | None           | None             |

The existing mechanism in OnTrack for admin users to add units can be utilized for course flow
units. An extra interface can be added in this where course flow specific definitions can be added
such as the unit level, requirements and categories. However, it is important to note that
leveraging out this mechanism will mean that a unit will be added despite not having any
associations to OnTrack's task and assessment system.

**Requirements**

This model will play an important role with defining the requirements of courses and units which
will be used on the client side to update visuals for the user.

Requirement types can be defined as a string (or Enum) and will generally fall under these types:

| Requirement Types          |
| -------------------------- |
| CreditPointRequirement     |
| RequiredUnits              |
| UnitsRestriction           |
| UnitLevelRestriction       |
| PickFromRequirementOptions |

To handle the specific requirements, we can model the data with the requirement type and the
requirement definition.

As an example, for credit points requirement, the model will look like the table below.

| Field                  | Type   | Description                      |
| ---------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------- |
| requirementTpe         | String | Requirement type string.         |
| creditPointRequirement | int    | Minimum number of credit points. |

In the course or units data, their list of requirements will then contain the above model as an
entry with the respective minimum credit points type and an integer defining the actual credit
points requirement (24 for example).

Another example includes pre-requisites, which will have a list of unit string ids, along with a
requirement type that may be labelled as "pre-requisites".

| Field               | Type     | Description                                        |
| ------------------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| requirementTpe      | String   | Requirement type string.                           |
| preRequisiteUnitIds | String[] | List of strings containing the unique id of units. |

Likewise, this will be another entry in the requirements list.

It is worth mentioning that since some courses provide students with the ability to choose a
requirement out of a a list of requirements, the PickFromRequirementOptions will be utilized to
achieve this and will essentially nest requirements within groups.

In terms of adding the requirements, the course flow courses and units admin components can have a
section dedicated to adding requirements.

Also, in the current iteration of the implementation of CourseFlow, the task and logic of matching
requirement types to a specific requirement will be handled on the front end. Further considerations
to this approach and handling will be made after implementation and testing.

As more courses and units are added, more requirement types will be added accordingly.


### 4.4 - Wireframes

**CourseFlow Entry**

This is what a user will expect upon entering CourseFlow without having set a course previously.
Interest area options will alter the list of courses that will appear.

![CourseFlow Entry](/course-flow-entry.png)

**CourseFlow Course Map with Courses Tab Selected**

This is the wireframe of the course map with the course menu selected.

A few things to note:

- Course requirements displayed on the left.
- Containers for years, trimesters and unit slots.
- Unit cards with validity indicators.
- Ability to add/delete the the above mentioned containers

![CourseFlow Course Map with Course Menu](/course-flow-course-map-1.png)

**CourseFlow Course Map with Unit Tab Selected**

This is the same wireframe as above but with the unit side menu selected. This will allow users to
select units based on interest area.

![CourseFlow Course Map with Unit Menu](/course-flow-course-map-2.png)

**CourseFlow Detailed Unit Overlay**

Basically an overlay interface that shows more details about the unit and provides more details on
requirement with progress tracking.

## 5 - Development Plan

This will be the development plan in order of priorities:

1. Define the endpoints for the CourseFlow backend.
2. Create some tests in Postman to ensure all endpoints are working properly.
3. Gather course data (will focus on adding one course first which will likely be the Bachelor of
   Computer Science) and place the required information in a json file - this will be the default
   course data for development.
4. Gather some unit data and add to json file - this will be the default data for development.
5. Make more detailed UI/UX designs that expand on the wireframes already done.
6. Implement the designs for the frontend.
7. Connect the frontend with the backend.
