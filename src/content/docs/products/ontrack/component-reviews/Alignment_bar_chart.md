## Component Name

\*\*\*\*./src/app/visualisation/alignment-bar-chart.coffee

File Name: aligment-bar-chart.coffee

## Component purpose

It is used to display a bar chart visualizing some form of data alignment, possibly within an
educational or analytics dashboard.

## Component outcomes/interactions

It displays data in a bar chart format, enabling users to quickly understand data distribution and
alignment.

## Existing component

![figure_1](/alig-bar-chart-1)

The existing component uses AngularJS and CoffeeScript to render a bar chart, potentially with
libraries such as D3.js.

## Strategy 1: Basic Migration

- Purpose

Migrate alignment-bar-chart.coffee from AngularJS to Angular, maintaining all existing
functionalities and ensuring correct data and style bindings.

- outcome component

![figure_1](/alig-bar-chart-1.png)

- Basic Code

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, Input } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  selector: "app-alignment-bar-chart",
  templateUrl: "./alignment-bar-chart.component.html",
  styleUrls: ["./alignment-bar-chart.component.scss"],
})
export class AlignmentBarChartComponent implements OnInit {
  @Input() data: any[];

  ngOnInit() {
    this.renderChart();
  }

  private renderChart() {
    // Implement chart rendering logic here
  }
}
```

- Migration Checklist

1. Data Binding
2. Chart Rendering
3. Responsive Updates
4. User Interactions

## Strategy 2: Enhanced Interactivity

- Purpose

Build upon the basic migration by adding interactivity, such as detailed information on bar click or
tooltips on hover.

- outcome component

1. Displaying detailed information directly.

![figure_1](/alig-bar-chart-2.png)

2. When the user clicks on a bar chart, provide more detailed data or perform certain actions.

![figure_1](/alig-bar-chart-3.png)

3. Enhance user interface feedback, such as through animation or color changes, to make the user
   interface more active and eye-catching.

![figure_1](/alig-bar-chart-4.png)

- Basic Code

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, Input } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  // ...same decorators as Strategy 1
})
export class AlignmentBarChartComponent implements OnInit {
  // ...same properties and ngOnInit as Strategy 1

  onBarClick(item: any) {
    // Handle bar click event here
  }

  onBarHover(item: any) {
    // Show tooltips here
  }
}
```

- Migration Checklist

1. Enhanced Interactivity
2. Event Handling
3. Dynamic Tooltips

## Strategy 3: Responsive Design and Accessibility

- Purpose

Ensure that the migrated component functions well across different devices and screen sizes and
meets accessibility standards.

- Basic code

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit, Input } from "@angular/core";

@Component({
  // ...same decorators as Strategy 1
})
export class AlignmentBarChartComponent implements OnInit {
  // ...same properties and ngOnInit as Strategy 1
  // Additional methods for responsive and accessibility features
  // Implement methods for responsive design and accessibility here
}
```

- Migration Checklist

1. Responsive Design
2. Accessibility Support
3. Screen Reader Compatibility
4. Keyboard Navigation

## Conclusion

The migration from AngularJS to Angular represents a significant modernization of the application's
front-end architecture. It not only aligns with the latest web development standards but also
provides a more robust platform for future development. The proposed strategies outline a phased
approach, starting with a basic migration to maintain current functionality, then enhancing
interactivity, and finally ensuring that the component is responsive and accessible.

Each strategy has been thoughtfully designed to minimize disruption and to make the transition as
smooth as possible. It's important to conduct thorough testing after each phase to ensure that the
component behaves as expected across all scenarios. This step-by-step migration also facilitates a
clearer understanding of the component's structure and dependencies, which can be beneficial for
future maintenance and upgrades.

By adhering to these strategies, we aim to leverage Angular's powerful features to create a more
dynamic, efficient, and user-friendly experience. As we proceed, continuous integration and delivery
practices will be followed to ensure that new changes are properly integrated and that any issues
are promptly addressed.

The success of this migration will set a precedent for future migrations and will pave the way for a
more modern, maintainable, and scalable application.
