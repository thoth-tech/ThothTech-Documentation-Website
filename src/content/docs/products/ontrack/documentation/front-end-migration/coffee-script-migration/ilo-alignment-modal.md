### Component outcomes/interactions

User should login with admin or convenor account.

It sets a unit taks's aligment rating to a given learning outcome from admin or convenor account and
apply justification as how it relates to that particular learning outcome.

It works through popup window for Admin/ Convenor accounts, includes the adding rating and
justification for given learning outcome of the task. The given ratig is displayed through a number
(1-5).

The new migrated component expected to work the same way as the existing component.

This modal has proper mechanism, but some of the changes can be proposed to enhance this.

So, in the proposed modal the user provides the following changes:

1.Progress bar should be alighned to center of the popup window 2.The assignment name and the
learning outcome is displayed through bold letters, not in the colored boxes 3.The rational message
should be displayed with proper alignment and font size.

New design sketch: Existing UI components are to be used for the input fields and button etc. ``

In these two proposed models, the user provides the following changes:

4.A progress bar with a color range can be used to replace current progress buttons. 5.A pie chart
can be added to rate learning outcomes.

New design sketch: proposed different design, existing UI components are to be used for the input
fields and button etc.
