title: SplashKit Tutorials
description: A compilation of SplashKit tutorials with recommendations for improvement.
---

On this page is a compilation of SplashKit tutorials and tutorial proposals. Areas of potential
improvement have been marked.

The tutorials have been layed out in categories that seem reasonable for further development. There
is a need for both tutorials that focus on specific areas (such as sprites, or audio), along with
tutorials that bring these concepts together cohesively (like the Metroidvania series).

## Current Tutorials

- Website Links: [_Live_](https://splashkit.io/guides/sprites/sprite-layering-tutorial/)

#### _Getting Started With Sprites in Splashkit - C#_

- Overview: Explanation of what sprites are in SplashKit.
- Status: Needs Improvement/Checking
  - Is quite good! One thing that might make it better is to just improve the explanation of what a
    sprite is, since a sprite isn't really a bitmap, it's closer to an instantiation of a bitmap (as
    mentioned later on in it).

#### _Sprite Pack Documentation_

- Overview: An API reference for Sprite Packs.
- Status: Needs Improvement/Checking
  - As mentioned, not really a tutorial. Would be good as part of an API page.
- Repo Links:
  [_SplashKit-Tutorial_](https://github.com/thoth-tech/SplashKit-Tutorial/blob/main/Tutorial%20Proposals/Sprite%20Pack%20Documentation.md)

### Audio

#### _Get started with SplashKit Audio_

- Overview: A guide on playing sound effects and music.
- Status: Needs improvement
  - A bit bare-bones. See the proposal 'Introduction to Splashkit Audio and Music Functions' for
    perhaps a good replacement.
- Repo Links:
  [_splashkit.io_](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit.io/tree/develop/source/articles/guides/2018-06-10-about-audio.html.md.erb)

---

### Networking

:::note[Thoughts]

While these tutorials are quite good, they feel very disconnected from the rest of SplashKit.
Wouldn't creating a (very simple) multiplayer game have been a better subject? I don't think anyone
is going to make a website using SplashKit.

:::

#### _Getting Started With Servers_

- Overview: A detailed tutorial about creating a web server that serves a file.
- Status: Completed
- Repo Links:
  [_splashkit.io_](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit.io/tree/develop/source/articles/guides/2018-07-14-getting-started-with-servers.html.md.erb)

- Website Links: [_Live_](https://splashkit.io/guides/networking/restful-api-call/)

---

### Databases

#### _Using Databases_

- Overview: An introduction to interacting with databases via SplashKit.
- Status: Needs Improvement/Checking
  - The tutorial is well written and engaging. Only thing missing perhaps is a better explanation of
    what a database is, since SplashKit is targetted at beginnners who may not know what they are. A
    visual example with tables might be good?
- Repo Links:
  [_splashkit.io_](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit.io/tree/develop/source/articles/guides/2017-10-03-using-databases.html.md)
  [_splashkit.io-starlight_](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit.io-starlight/blob/master/src/content/docs/guides/Database/using-databases.mdx)
- Website Links: [_Live_](https://splashkit.io/guides/database/using-databases/)

#### _Getting Started With SplashKit Database_

- Overview: A much more in-depth tutorial on the database functions (closer to an API reference).
- Status: Completed
- Repo Links:
  [_documentation_](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/Splashkit/Applications/Tutorials%20and%20Research/Tutorial%20Proposals/Tutorial%20Markdowns/Getting%20Started%20With%20SplashKit%20Database.md)

---

### JSON

#### _Using JSON_

- Overview: A short explanation of JSON with a code example.
- Status: Needs improvement
  - Doesn't provide much explanation of JSON nor why one would want to use it. The code example
    clearly demonstrates writing, but is missing reading that data back in.
- Repo Links:
  [_splashkit.io_](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit.io/tree/develop/source/articles/guides/2017-10-03-using-json.html.md)

- Website Links: [_Live_](https://splashkit.io/guides/utilities/useful-utilities/)

### Game Creation

:::note[Thoughts]

While these tutorials are quite decent, they suffer from what seems to be a big problem. There isn't
actually a completed project that the tutorials are leading up to, and since some of the parts are
written by different people, there is a lack of continuity. Something introduced by one tutorial (as
an example: creating a floor using sprites), is then forgotten about in a future tutorial (which
then opts to quickly add a ground by drawing rectangles). <br/> It would be good if there was a
'source-of-truth' codebase for the finished game, that can then be used as a base to keep the
tutorials cohesive even when written by different people.

#### _Creating a 2D Metroidvania Game (1, 2, 5, 6, 12)_

- Overview: A series on producing a Metroidvania game, have only skim read. Seems quite thorough and
  well written.
- Status: Completed
- Repo Links:
  [_SplashKit-Tutorial_](https://github.com/thoth-tech/SplashKit-Tutorial/blob/main/Tutorials/Creating%20a%202D%20Metroidvania%20Game%20Using%20Splashkit/)

#### _Creating a 2D Metroidvania Game (2)_

- Overview: See above.

**Note:** There are **two** 'Part 2's, with somewhat overlapping content. Someone will need to
choose which one to use in the final series, or merge bits of them together. While this tutorial
suggests it comes after the _other_ part 2, I would recommend putting this one first, since this one
covers project creation with `skm new`, and doesn't go into as much detail about drawing graphics.

#### _CMake Tutorials 1 to 8_

- Overview: Tutorials on the syntax of CMake.
- Status: Needs Improvement/Checking
  - While these are well written, they don't have a whole lot to do with SplashKit aside from the
    final one (see below). Should they use and reference the SplashKit cmake file as an example each
    time?

- Repo Links:
  [_the-programmers-field-guide_](https://github.com/splashkit/the-programmers-field-guide/tree/main/src/content/docs/book/part-0-getting-started/3-building-programs/)

### Other (are these actually proposals?)

#### _Game Concept Ideas_

- Overview: An article on resources to help with coming up with game concepts and resources.
- Status: Needs improvement
  - While it's solid as an article, the way it presents itself as the first tutorial in a series
    (which as far as I can tell does not exist) makes its actual goal confusing. Unless further
    tutorials in this series will be made, I suggest re-writing parts of it to make it self
    contained. Is it actually a proposal? If so, why is it so long?
- Repo Links:

  [_SplashKit-Tutorial_](https://github.com/thoth-tech/SplashKit-Tutorial/blob/main/Game%20Concept.md)

#### _Design Tutorial for 2D racer_

- Overview: An article describing some principles of UX/UI
- Status: Needs improvement
  - Same thoughts as above. It's solid as an introductory article, but it isn't a tutorial. Again,
    perhaps it's a proposal?
- Repo Links:

  [_SplashKit-Tutorial_](https://github.com/thoth-tech/SplashKit-Tutorial/blob/main/2d%20Racer%20Design%20tutorial.md)

#### _Controls_

- Overview: A list of the controls needed to be compatible with the arcade machine. Not a tutorial.
- Status: Needs improvement
  - The file itself is fine, but it shouldn't be in tutorials.
- Repo Links:
  [_SplashKit-Tutorial_](https://github.com/thoth-tech/SplashKit-Tutorial/blob/main/Tutorials/arcade_controls.md)

## [For Reference] Current SplashKit Tutorial/Proposal Directories

All the directories listed below contain either tutorials or proposals (or both). In its current
state, tutorials and proposals seem to be mixed together and files from the same series are
scattered across folders. There is also a lot of duplication.

The current plan for future tutorials seems to be to store all tutorials under
[splashkit.io-starlight](https://github.com/thoth-tech/splashkit.io-starlight), and all tutorial
proposals under
[ThothTech-Documentation-Website](https://github.com/thoth-tech/ThothTech-Documentation-Website). We
should attempt to migrate all tutorials to fit under that structure at some point. There are also
some completed tutorials that are not currently live on any site - it should be investigated if
there is a reason for this.
