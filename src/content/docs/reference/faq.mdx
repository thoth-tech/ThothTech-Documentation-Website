  <summary>Which Thoth Tech repository should I clone to contribute to the Documentation Website</summary>

  <summary>When I attempt to run the documentation website locally, it says "The .nvmrc file is using a

  <summary>How do I make a newly created folder to appear on the side navbar of the Documentation website?</summary>

  On the astro.config.mjs file, create a new label (if main folder) or item(if sub folder). You do not
  need to reinvent the will, you can copy from what already exists on the astro.config.mjs file, insert
  the copied block into the right location, and modify the labels and directory link.

  Format document with markdownlint. Ensure that you have the markdownlint extension installed on your

<details>
  <summary>I currently have a Pull Request that is still under Review, when I make a commit for a new change, 
  I am unable to create another Pull Request. Why is that?</summary>

Because your Pull Request is still under Review and you are pushing changes from the same GitHub
account (which is your personal one) your new commit will still fall under your old PR. No cause for
alarm, if all checks in your PR has passed, then reach out to your approver to approve it so you can
create a new PR for new commits.
