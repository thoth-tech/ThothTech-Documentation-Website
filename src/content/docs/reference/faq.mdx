  <summary>When I attempt to run the documentation website locally, it says "The .nvmrc file is using a

  <summary>How do I make a newly created folder to appear on the side navbar of the Documentation website?</summary>

  On the astro.config.mjs file, create a new label (if main folder) or item(if sub folder). You do not
  need to reinvent the will, you can copy from what already exists on the astro.config.mjs file, insert
  the copied block into the right location, and modify the labels and directory link.
