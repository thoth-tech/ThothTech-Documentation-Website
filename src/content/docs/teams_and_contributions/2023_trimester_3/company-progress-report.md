## Executive Summary

Thoth Tech is a software development company currently building from the ground up in Melbourne,
Australia.

Thoth Tech’s mission is to build, operate, and deploy education technologies, creating tools that
enhance education outcomes by empowering students, connecting them with tutors, and facilitating
personalised learning experiences.

We value our people, and we value excellence. We are people-focused, aiming to produce sustainable
products of excellent quality, and provide frameworks that supply a safe environment for learning
and support of our team.

This report will outline the company structure, charter, objectives–both short and long term, and
explore each product’s goals.

In trimester 3, Thoth Tech would be running three products namely: OnTrack, Splash Kit, and Company
Operations. In addition to the three main products, the Courseflow project would undergo a rigorous
planning phase were the benefits, aims, and solution design would be generated to create a structure
for the project in subsequent trimesters. Students would be allocated to any of the three products
and would be required to contribute to achieve the objectives of the product.

Company Operations oversees the entire affairs of Thoth Tech and strives to make things easier.
Effective operations are important for maintaining a successful business. As other product teams
focus to develop new features and upgrade existing products, we would be working to ensure that
appropriate industry guidelines and standards are followed to produce world class products. We
document the tools and processes that Thoth tech uses in its daily operations and research new
options that could serve the company better.

OnTrack is one of the bigger projects in the company and is a live production system that is in use
at Deakin University, it has been consistently improved and built upon to provide an exceptional
learning tool for students and staff at Deakin. Its technology stack consists of a Ruby on Rails
back end and an Angular JS / Angular 15 front end. There are a variety of projects to enhance and

### OnTrack

#### Ontrack Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This trimester Ontrack will be working dynamically across a variety of projects. We will be working
based on a priority system to get as many useful changes implemented as possible in the trimester.

We will be breaking each project into smaller subcomponents to allow people to work across projects
in areas that are strong at or interested in. Everything should be completable in a 2- week sprint.

#### OnTrack Aims for Trimester

The Key projects we would like to see movement on this trimester would be:

1. Improvements Backlog – This backlog has core improvements to the system we want to see.
2. Ontrack Bugs Backlog – These are bugs that are found and added to this backlog.
3. New Feature – Incorporate Content – Ideally, we have an additional 2 designs of how this would
   work. It's not ready to code just yet.
4. New Feature – Staff Grant Extensions – Ideally, we have an additional 2 designs of how this would
   work. It's not ready to code just yet.

5. New Feature – Tutor Times – Ideally, we have 2 additional designs on how this would work. It's
   not ready to code just yet.
6. Backlog Urgent Enhancements – These are important changes we are looking to get done as soon as
   possible.
7. Documentation – We want to focus on updating the Front and Backend Documentation and testing in
   this trimester. This will help students and other users better understand the system and how it
   works.

#### OnTrack Deliverables

Our main deliverables will be based on story points completed in the Trello tasks; we are aiming for
students to complete between 5-6 Story points every 2-week sprint.

### Courseflow

#### Courseflow Overview, Goals, and Objectives

CourseFlow aims to assist students in planning and comprehending the requirements and structuring of
university courses. Users can generate and adjust their CourseMap to account for changes. For
instance, a student will be able to see their expected graduation date or complications that may
arise if they complete units in a particular order or study load.

#### Courseflow Aims for Trimester

- Create a detailed design for the project.
- Create a document that justifies the need for the Courseflow product.
- Generate a project roadmap
- Begin implementation on approved designs.

#### Courseflow Deliverables

The main deliverable is to produce a detailed design and structured roadmap for Courseflow by the
end of trimester 3.

#### Courseflow Description of Progress

1. **CourseFlow Software Design Document**

   - Analysed previous work done for CourseFlow.
   - Re-designed CourseFlow based on analysis and re-established requirements and created a software
     design document.
   - After first review, updated software design document to treat CourseFlow as a new feature of
     OnTrack.
   - Added an ERD to model the data and their relationships with each other and OnTrack as part of
     this new update.

2. **University of Melbourne Course Planner Research Document**

   - Explored the UoM course planner to look at their features.
   - Analysed data retrieved to see how it is structured for inspiration in CourseFlow's data
     modelling.

3. Enhancement of the current ERD with further breakdown of the data models.

### Splash Kit

#### Splash Kit Overview, Goals, and Objectives

Splashkit is an all-purpose toolkit for beginners built in C++ and can be used with C++ and C#.
Deakin University uses it to introduce students to programming through its easy-to-use functions.

As part of the Splashkit team, you will be responsible for expanding the toolkit functions,
developing improved and innovative ways of working with Splashkit and creating educational documents
and videos for students.

#### Splash Kit Aims for Trimester

See Card Status in Backlog for Additional details and Completed Research Cards. The following
projects and tasks stated below are what we aim to work on this trimester.

#### SplashKit Arcade

- Create an automated game download system for Arcade Machines

  - The proposed system will use the Arcade-games Repo to check for updates in the game version and
    download the latest version
  - Games should have a Publish tag or similar to be loaded to the main menu.
  - Have a secondary game menu for test games/non-published.

- Updates to Arcade Menu

  - Presently the Arcade machine uses Emulation Station forked from the RetorPI project version.
    <https://github.com/thoth-tech/ArcadeMenu>
  - Create a new system for test games
  - See if we can modify the EM menu for the following
    - Trigger Game download scripts
    - Additional modes
      - Kiosk – Only show Published Games (for Events)
      - Normal – Has Published and Test Systems
  - Via script or other method have games exit after 10 min's if there's been no key Input

- Stretch Goals/Interesting ideas

  - Consider a local Test Mode – Arcade Switches to AP mode displays connection info (random
    password) and has a web server student can drop new game build on and tests. The machine Would
    delete the game and reset after a period of time.
    - Security would be a big consideration on this idea as it would be easy to abuse and not much
      in the way of logging vs official upload via Git Hub.
  - Implement a voting system on the Arcade Machine to give meaning to the star ranking.

  - Arcade Games – GitHub Actions

    - Correct C# for Arm (this should be done; see [trello card](https://trello.com/c/qeYlMImY) for
      Status)
      - Dotnet does not run correctly in the Emulated PI environment used for C++ games. New Action
        was created for compiling dotnet vs Arm games small bug in checking logic to be fixed before
        merge.
    - Update Arcade – Games Readme
      - Updated Controle to correctly reflect the Arcade machine
      - Updated on new Compiling Process
      - Instruct that All Game Assets must go into the Resources Folder (Action does try to capture
        root directories like images, sound, etc.) This includes level maps etc., or they won't
        upload to Arcade Machines
    - Implement Versioning for compiled games.
      - A simple version file in the games directory receives an incremental bump every time the
        game is updated so the Arcade knows to get the latest version.
      - This file can also contain additional information for the Arcade Menu. (Author, Publisher,
        other)
    - Retrieve and Compile Games from SubModules
    - Formalise Process with Deakin Staff on how Students from Classes like SIT102 or SIT771 can
      upload games to the Arcade Machine
      - Barrier will be using GitHub for new students, especially as this will use submodules.
      - Consider creating scripts to automate the linking of sub-modules

  - Move All games to Sub-Modules
    - Games made by Toth-Tech should be moved to their own repo, (or we can consider a separate
      Company if we don't want to crowd the Githubn too Much)
    - This will potentially allow Linking to Other Student Repos.

#### Splashkit Expansion

- Priority Items Deployment Packages

  - Debian Package.
  - Nuget Package.
  - Brew Package.

- Check for Further Functions from [Swin games](https://github.com/macite/swingame)to port into
  splashkit.
- Fix Python Compatibility

  - Python can no longer be used to code games with SplashKit. Previous research indicates a change
    with v3.8; see
    [here](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/Splashkit/Extensions/Python%20Compatibality/Research%20%26%20Findings/Python%20Changelog.md).

- Look at Adding AI function to SplashKit

  - Can look at LLMs like ChatGPT
  - Similar Functions to <https://scikit-learn.org/>

- Dev Container Mac

  - As most SplashKit Programs have a visual component and not browser-based based, we need a way to
    view the program's window output. This is normally accomplished by xserver forwarding and sound
    via pulse audio.
  - Mac xquartz is a xserver compatible with Mac Instaitl Tests container that can be setup and run
    x based programs e.g. xeyes but there is a compatibility issue with the graphics system in
    SplashKit. Further investigation is needed.

- SplashKit.io

  - Publish Astro Starlight site
    - The Aim will be to convert Splashkit.io to our new webpage platform.
    - Advise getting a subdomain like new.splashkit.io (or similar) setup for testing, and
      Transition will just be a DNS change then
  - Thorough documentation of the new site is needed
  - The Existing SplashKit.io may have a function to auto-update the API pages based on functions
    added to SplashKit. This should be investigated and replicated in the new site.

- Game Engine

  - Project Setup: Create a streamlined project setup process for easier onboarding and development.
  - Camera System: Implement a flexible and efficient camera system to handle different views and
    perspectives.
  - Transforms: Develop a system for handling object transformations like translation, rotation, and
    scaling.
  - Event System: Design an event system for handling game events in an extensible manner.
  - Input Handling System: Implement a robust input handling system to manage user interactions.

- Documentation Migration
  - As the company is moving to a new documentation repository a data Migration will need to occur
    between the existing documentation repo and the new one.
  - Work with company operations to plan the migration, but the SplashKit team needs to move the
    existing document over (also consider it a good opportunity to clean house and archive older
    information)
