## Thoth Tech Products and Mentors

By the end of week 1, it is expected that everyone has been assigned to a team and has engaged with
the product leads and mentors. In any product/team you find yourself ensure that you follow the
rules and guidelines of the team. Only 3 Thoth Tech products would be worked on this trimester. The
products and respective mentors are listed below.

1. Ontrack: Daniel Maddern
2. SplashKit: Olivia McKeon
3. Company Operations: Amin Abken

For every product, the mentors would hold at least 2 weekly meetings, and this would also serve as
the products weekly meetings where every member of the team converges to discuss the product
objective, populate Trello board, assign tasks, and discuss any roadblocks or impediments.

## Contributing and Producing Acceptable Evidence

Useful tips to contributing in your assigned teams

- The outcome of every task assigned to you would be required to be published to your teams GitHub
  repo. The GitHub link for every product can be found by clicking the product
  [here](https://main--strong-fairy-c1bde1.netlify.app/products/products/).
- To ensure you are accurately publishing to GitHub, review the GitHub policy
  [here](https://main--strong-fairy-c1bde1.netlify.app/policies/github-management-policy/).
- All documents are written in Markdown.
- Tasks would be assigned to you via the Trello board.

**Important!!**

- When you raise a Pull request, it needs to be reviewed by another student after which the student
  who reviewed would leave a comment on the PR stating if it can be progressed to be approved by the
  mentor.

## Providing acceptable evidence

This trimester every evidence provided must have an associated Pull Request. Some ways to ensure you
can produce acceptable evidence are.

1. Any research work should be documented using our Spike template and published to your products
   GitHub repo. The Spike Plan Template can be found
   [here](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/Templates/SpikePlan-Template.md)
2. Any solution testing performed (whether successful or not) should be documented using our Spike
   template. The Spike Outcome Template can be found
   [here](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/blob/main/docs/Templates/SpikeOutcome-Template.md)
3. Any change to a product in development or production stage should be pushed to the relevant
   GitHub repo.
4. Document all hours in your personal/team worklog. Every student must complete a minimum of 120
   hours to pass the unit.
