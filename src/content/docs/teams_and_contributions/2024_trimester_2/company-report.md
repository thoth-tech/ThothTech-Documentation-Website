### Completed Deliverables

This trimester, the following key deliverables were completed:

- Bug Fixes and Urgent Enhancements

  - Chat Markdown Rendering Bug: Successfully fixed an issue where markdown was not rendering
    properly in chat, enhancing the user experience for students and staff.
  - Documentation Enhancements: Completed and merged documentation updates for both general and
    specific API pages. This includes contributions from team members on various entities such as
    requirement sets and course entities, directly supporting the goal of comprehensive
    documentation for OnTrack's evolving features.

- Frontend Enhancements and Component Migrations: Several components have been successfully migrated
  to Angular 17 and TypeScript, including the comments-modal, group set manager, and
  unit-ilo-edit-modal. Additionally, enhancements were made to PDF handling and user interface
  elements like the grade-task-modal and grade-icon components, contributing to the ongoing frontend
  migration and user interface improvement objectives.

  - Ongoing Frontend Migration: The migration of legacy CoffeeScript components to
    TypeScript/Angular continues, with files such as timeout.coffee and grade-task-modal.coffee
    currently under peer review. This aligns with our aim to complete at least 10% of the existing
    frontend migration backlog this trimester.
  - Overlay Component Creation: Developed a new overlay component to provide additional information
    about units to users, enhancing the user interface and experience. This feature is currently
    under review.

- CourseFlow:

  - CourseMap Base Page Development: Developed the base page for CourseMap, laying the groundwork
    for further enhancements and integrations planned for the CourseFlow component.
  - Backend Requirements Implementation: Completed backend requirements for several critical
    entities, including the requirement set, course, and course map unit entities. These efforts are
    part of the overarching aim to enhance CourseFlow functionality and ensure robust backend
    support for new and existing features.
  - CourseFlow Enhancements: Several enhancements are under review, including adding authentication
    to endpoints and integrating new UI elements. These efforts are part of the continued
    development of the CourseFlow API and its related functionalities.

- JPLAG - jplag software plagiarism has been implemented as a containerised batch process. Frontend
  and backend additions have been made to allow plagiarism report downloads.
- Dev Container Image Downsizing - LaTex and MariaDB have been moved into their own containers;
  reducing rebuild time of the main container significantly
- Nginx - an nginx container has been created to utilise reverse proxying, allowing localhost:4200
  and localhost:3000 to be accessed at localhost/ and localhost/api

- Ongoing and Pending Tasks:
  - Group Set Manager Migration: The migration of the group set manager component to the latest
    framework is in progress.
  - Unit Group Set Editor Migration: The migration of the unit-group-set-editor.coffee file
    continues to move forward, aligning with our frontend migration goals.
  - Tasks in Peer Review: Detailed documentation and API operations for units and task definitions,
    along with the migration of several legacy components, are currently under peer review. This
    work supports the ongoing documentation efforts and frontend migration initiatives.

### Roadmap

The following are areas of OnTrack students may choose to work on in Trimester 3, 2024:

- Frontend Migrations – Angular.js and CoffeeScript to Angular and TypeScript
- Urgent Enhancements, Improvements, and Bugs
- Documentation Website – Enhance and add missing endpoint documentation
- Peer reviews for previous pull requests and contributions
- Features in development:
  - Tutor Feedback Enhancement – feedback_api will require further development to support
    "criterion" or options
  - CourseFlow – remaining backend entities and frontend
  - Incorporate Multiple Organizations on Single OnTrack Server
  - Authentication Module
  - Tutor Times
  - Incorporate Content in OnTrack
  - Staff Grant Extensions
  - Panopto Video Integration

### Open Issues

These are some of the common challenges we have faced in Trimester 2, 2024 and may continue to face
in the future:

1. Knowledge gap in using Git and GitHub – Team members are required to upskill in Git before
   starting on their assigned tasks as this is the primary tool used within the team to manage code
   and contributions. The Git and GitHub training website and demo videos attached in this document
   are some of the great resources available in capstone for this purpose.

2. Unsatisfactory pull request reviews – Reviews must not be made through generational AI tools or
   just indicate how many commits have been made and what has changed. Instead, it must evaluate the
   syntax, logic, and output of the code. Please refer to section Task Review for more details and
   this past review for an example of a correct pull request review.

### Lessons Learned

This trimester, the traditional weekly Help Hub sessions, typically held on Thursdays and led by
senior team members, experienced a noticeable decrease in attendance.

To adapt, student leads focused on driving engagement and addressing queries through the OnTrack
public Teams channel, encouraging team members to share their experiences and solutions.

While this approach has been effective for accommodating team members' diverse schedules, we
recommend exploring new ways to host Help Hub sessions alongside asynchronous Teams posts. Offering
multiple formats for assistance could provide additional opportunities for leadership development.

Future student leads may consider using polls or forms to determine the most suitable time for
sessions based on team availability. Additionally, offering a variety of session formats could help
not only resolve existing problems but also guide team members in making contributions to specific
areas.

### Product Development Life Cycle

We continue to use Agile methodologies to deliver updates and new features for OnTrack.

Our approach includes 2-week sprints focused on completing tasks, and weekly stand-up meetings to
assess progress, share updates, discuss roadblocks, and assign new tasks via Teams Planner cards.

#### New Tasks

New tasks are assigned by the project mentor during the weekly stand-up meetings. Once you are
assigned a task, be sure to assign yourself to the corresponding Teams Planner card and attach your
draft or completed pull request when you begin work.

If you have an idea for a new feature or enhancement, schedule a meeting with the project mentor to
discuss it. Upon approval, create a new card or backlog column in Teams Planner to track the task.
If the feature is large, start researching the benefits and challenges, and create a Spike document,
which can be committed to the documentation repository. Spike templates are available in the
documentation repository.

#### Definition of Done

A task is considered complete once it has been fully tested, functions as expected, and is
documented in a well-organized pull request.

The task must also undergo peer review and be approved by your mentor. Ensure that the corresponding
Teams Planner card is updated, and keep in communication with your reviewer and mentor until your
contribution is merged into the upstream doubtfire-lms repository.

#### Task Review

Each pull request requires a mandatory peer review before a mentor review. After creating the pull
request, contact a teammate to review it.

Tag them as the reviewer in both the Teams Planner card and the GitHub pull request. As a reviewer,
ensure that you test the code by pulling the changes locally and reviewing the syntax, logic, and
output.

If any changes are needed, update the contribution and notify the reviewer. Once the updates are
made, the pull request will be automatically updated.

After the peer review is complete, notify the mentor for their review. Once approved, you can submit
the pull request to the upstream repository for the final review.

#### Testing

For frontend changes, test the functionality in the browser or run specification tests as needed.
For backend changes, use browser interactions or tools like Postman to test functionality.
Additionally, GitHub CI Actions will run tests automatically when changes are pushed.

In the pull request template, include detailed instructions on how others can test your changes.
Always provide before-and-after screenshots to show the outcome of your modifications.

#### Branching Strategy

When starting a new contribution, fork all three thoth-tech repositories (deploy, web, and API) to
your GitHub profile.

Create a new branch from the development branch of the relevant repository. For example, for
frontend migrations, you would create a branch from the doubtfire-web development branch.

Follow the Branch Prefixes and Commit Message Format in the Contributing Guide when naming branches
and creating commits.

### Product Architecture

OnTrack is built using four main components:

1. Frontend Client: Responsible for user interactions.
2. Backend API: Handles requests and serves data.
3. Database: Stores application data.
4. Deployment Infrastructure: Ensures that OnTrack is properly deployed and maintained

#### Tech Stack

- Frontend: Currently being migrated from AngularJS and CoffeeScript to Angular 17 and TypeScript.
  The stack also includes HTML, SCSS, and Tailwind CSS.
- Backend: Built on Ruby on Rails with the Grape Framework. It uses MariaDB as the database engine.
  Docker is used for deployment and local development.

## Project 2: SplashKit

### Project Overview

SplashKit is a user-friendly programming framework designed for creating 2D games, primarily to help
students learn introductory programming through game development. The framework is mainly written in
C++, but it supports multiple languages, including C#, Python, Pascal, and JavaScript.

### Projects

#### Arcade Machines

The university has acquired four arcade machines equipped with Raspberry Pi 3B+ units, designed to
showcase games developed with SplashKit. The short-term goal is to prepare these platforms for
students to display their SplashKit creations. The medium-term goal is to streamline the process for
first-year students to easily upload and test their games.

#### Game Development

The Game Development team is dedicated to creating and enhancing games that run on the arcade
machines. Their mission is to demonstrate SplashKit’s capabilities and inspire students by
showcasing what can be achieved with the framework.

#### SplashKit Website

Powered by the Starlight framework, the revamped SplashKit website aims to offer an enriched and
user-friendly experience for developers and learners. It will host existing tutorials and guides,
providing a central hub for exploring and learning about SplashKit.

#### SplashKit Tutorials

The SplashKit Website will feature tutorials aimed at helping students learn and explore SplashKit’s
functionality. The focus is on developing smaller, high-quality tutorials across C++, C#, and
Python, rather than extensive series.

#### SplashKit Expansion

The Expansion team is responsible for maintaining and enhancing the SplashKit core. This includes
bug fixes, feature improvements, and refining installation and usage workflows through package
creation and addressing installation issues.

#### SplashKit Online

SplashKit Online is developing a web-based IDE that allows students to write and run code directly
in their browsers. Initially launched as a prototype in 2023, the 2024 goal is to mature this tool
into a comprehensive product, including C# support and an embeddable version for the SplashKit
website.

#### SplashKit Expansion

- Finish development of dev containers for SplashKit Core.
  [See here](https://github.com/thoth-tech/documentation/tree/main/docs/Splashkit/DevEnviroment/Windows_DevContainer)
  for more details.
- Deployment Packages:
  - Brew Package: Finalise and fix existing Brew packages to ensure smooth installation and usage.
- Test and Fix SplashKit Functionality:
  - Identify and resolve bugs in SplashKit functionality
  - Investigate bug regarding drawing text to second window. See
    [Issue #177](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core/issues/177) for more information.
  - Investigate and implement Pascal compilation fix. See
    [Issue #151](https://github.com/splashkit/splashkit-core/issues/151) and relevant Planner card
    for more information.
    - Fix handling of negative enums in SplashKit Translator (this should be done; see Planner card
      for status)
- Port SwinGame Functions to SplashKit:
  - Review and port missing functions from SwinGames into SplashKit.
- Investigate MinGW Compatibility
  - There have been issues with using SplashKit in MinGW, this needs to be investigated.

  - Improve GPIO Error Handling (this should be done; see Planner card for status)
  - Implement support for the Raspberry Pi 5, as current support only extends to Raspberry Pi 4B+.
- Further Integration Testing
  - Conduct detailed testing and bug fixing of SplashKit functionality.
  - Ensure both procedural and OOP versions of each function are thoroughly tested and reliable.
- Comprehensive Testing and Bug Fixing:
  - Develop a comprehensive automated test suite to regularly test SplashKit functionality and
    quickly identify and resolve new bugs. This ensures the framework remains stable and reliable as
    new features are added and updates are made.
    - Implement unit tests for functions without them
    - Add tests for translator targets C#, Python and Pascal.
      - Alternatively, investigate the difficulty of creating a translator module to automatically
        translate the existing C++ tests into the translator target languages

#### SplashKit Online

- Embed Lite Version into SplashKit Website:
  - Develop and implement a "lite" version of SplashKit Online for embedding in the SplashKit
    website to demonstrate code snippets and showcase functionalities.

  - Improve loading times and caching to ensure smooth performance.
- Improve Project Management
  - Project Handling: Add functionality for users to create, load, save, and delete projects within
    the browser, managing multiple projects with unique names.
  - Version Control: Integrate version control to track changes and revert to previous states as
    needed.
  - Export Project Builds: Enable exporting project builds as executables for C++ projects or single
    HTML files for JavaScript projects for better portability and sharing.
- Improve SplashKit Online Interface:
  - Code Editing and REPL Functionality: Implement auto-complete for variable parameters, add
    breakpoints, and create variable watch windows to improve coding and debugging.

  - C# Support: Continue to explore and add support for C# to broaden language options.
  - Python Support: Investigate and add support for Python to accommodate additional user needs.
- Advanced Project Features:
  - Integrated Code Snippets: Develop functionality for users to save and reuse code snippets within
    their projects.
  - Collaborative Features: Consider implementing collaborative features for simultaneous project
    work among multiple users.

#### Game Development

- Establish Standardised Implementation Patterns:
  - Enforce decoupling of data/functionality and decoupling of state/render patterns.
  - Develop a prescribed implementation pattern to ensure consistency and quality across projects.
- Develop a "10 Minute Game":
  - Collaboratively plan and execute the development of a simple game (e.g., idle game, tower
    defence, survivor.io-like).
  - Ensure core game mechanics are implemented in the first sprint.
  - Focus the latter half of the trimester on improving visual representation, adding "juice," and
    implementing variations of core game elements (e.g., enemies, powerups, weapons).
  - This approach ensures that core functionality is completed within a single trimester, with
    additional features developed against a standardised interface that integrates with the core
    game types.
- Iterate on Prescribed Patterns:
  - Adjust and refine the implementation pattern based on student feedback and experiences.
- Generate Development Artifacts:
  - Create documentation covering the implementation of discrete game systems (e.g., terrain
    generation systems using IDW/random walk/noise, 2D light marching, threaded state update and
    render patterns).
- Improve Documentation:
  - Existing games often lack adequate documentation. Good documentation can significantly increase
    onboarding speed for new contributors.
  - For completed games, create UML diagrams, overviews of gameplay mechanics, and guides for
    creating levels in each game’s format.
  - Address the discoverability of existing documentation and resources. Update README files to
    reflect the current focus of work and ensure existing documentation is easy to find.
- Complete Core Functionality of Incomplete Games:
  - Focus on finishing significant core functionalities in games that are currently incomplete
    (e.g., Sky Surge, Single Combat).
- Extend Gameplay and Functionality of Completed Games:
  - Enhance and expand the gameplay and features of games that are already completed, ensuring they
    continue to engage and challenge players.

### Open Issues

The SplashKit team has faced several challenges over Trimester 2, 2024. These are detailed below:

- Lack of Communication Between Project Groups
  - While individual communication channels, threads, and chats exist for each project, there is a
    notable absence of overarching organisation. The lack of regular meetings between teams or with
    the entire company has led to confusion, poor coordination, and duplicated efforts. In some
    cases, tasks were reassigned or duplicated by different team members without clear
    communication, causing disruptions in workflow. This decentralised communication structure has
    hindered collaboration across projects and created barriers to progress.
- Insufficient Onboarding Information and Lack of Codebase Exploration
  - A recurring issue was the lack of exploration of the existing codebase by team members, both in
    terms of finished and unfinished work. As a result, students often replicated previous efforts
    instead of building on them, such as recreating Git contribution guides or developer environment
    setup guides unnecessarily. This issue stems from insufficient documentation practices and a
    lack of familiarity with existing resources, causing inefficiencies and wasted effort.
- Team Members Performing Duplicate Work
  - The combination of communication gaps and poor documentation has directly led to duplicated
    work. Without a clear mechanism to track or share ongoing progress across teams, individuals
    have inadvertently recreated work completed by others. This redundancy has slowed down
    development and caused unnecessary strain on resources.

A possible solution to these issues would be the implementation of regular cross-team meetings and
company-wide updates. These would provide a clearer understanding of each team’s progress,
facilitate better collaboration, and reduce duplicated efforts. Additionally, enhancing overall
documentation and establishing more robust processes for tracking work across projects would help
ensure that past work is utilised effectively moving forward.

### Product Development Life Cycle

#### New Tasks

In SplashKit it is up to individuals to assign themselves to cards – generally speaking, it is fine
to assign oneself to any card unless otherwise noted. New cards are created by discussing the
problem with mentors, either during stand-ups or directly – if approved, the mentor will create the
card and you can assign yourself to it.

#### Definition of Done

A task is only considered fully done once it has been completed, submitted as a pull request, and
reviewed by two other students who approve it (see below). Once a mentor reviews it, it may be
considered fully complete, or potentially moved back to doing if unsatisfactory.

#### Task Review

Two mandatory peer reviews must be completed before the mentor review. Once the pull request is
made, contact a teammate for a review and upon agreement, tag this teammate under the Teams Planner
card and GitHub pull request as the reviewer. Make sure to review and test the code syntax, logic,
and output through pulling the changes unto your local machine if you are the reviewer. If the
reviewer requests any changes, update the contribution, and notify the reviewer. Once the changes
are committed and pushed, it will automatically update the pull request; thus, there is no need to
make another pull request.

from the OnTrack team on creating and reviewing someone else’s pull request.

Once the peer review is complete and your contribution was deemed correct by your teammate, the pull
request may be moved into the Mentor Review column – in time, a mentor will review the work, and if
it is deemed satisfactory it will be considered complete and moved into the current sprint’s
Complete column.

#### Testing

Testing strategies depend on the project – please see each project’s onboarding information for more
details.

#### Branching Strategy

Refer to the Branch Prefixes and Commit Message Format sections of the
[Git Contributions Guide](https://thoth-tech.netlify.app/resources/quality-assurance/git-contributions-guide/)
for guidelines on creating Git branches and commits for contributions.

### Product Architecture

#### SplashKit.io Website

The SplashKit.io website is the primary portal for developers and learners, offering a modern,
responsive interface built with Starlight (Astro), React, SolidJS, Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and
Docker. It provides users with access to API documentation, installation guides, and tutorials,
making it essential for anyone looking to learn or expand their knowledge of SplashKit. This website
supports external developers, especially beginners, in using SplashKit for 2D game development and
interactive applications.

#### SplashKit SDK

The SplashKit SDK is a versatile toolkit designed to simplify 2D game development and interactive
application creation. It is primarily built using C++, SDL, and OpenGL, and is managed through CMake
and Clang/LLVM. The SDK supports cross-platform development on Windows, macOS, Linux, and Raspberry
Pi, allowing developers to create applications that run on multiple platforms using a single
codebase. Additionally, the SDK includes automated translation into C#, Python, and Pascal.

#### SplashKit Online

SplashKit Online is a web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that enables users to
write, compile, and run SplashKit projects directly in their browsers. It supports JavaScript and
experimental C++ through WebAssembly (WASM) via Emscripten. The platform uses Node/NPM for
dependency management and test server operation. SplashKit Online aims to make it easy for
developers, particularly beginners, to get started with SplashKit without needing to install any
software.

#### Arcade Machine

The SplashKit-powered arcade machines, developed in collaboration with Deakin University, run on
Raspberry Pi using emulationstation and retropie. These machines allow students and developers to
upload and test games developed with SplashKit in a real-world arcade setting. The machines offer a
hands-on experience where games can be played and evaluated using physical arcade hardware.

#### Game Development

The Game Development team produces games that showcase SplashKit's capabilities. These games are
typically built using C++ or C# and adhere to industry-standard game design practices. The games
serve as examples of what can be achieved using SplashKit, demonstrating various features of the
SDK, including graphics, input handling, and audio management.
