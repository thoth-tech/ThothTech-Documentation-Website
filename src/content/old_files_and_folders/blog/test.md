Welcome to our brand new blog! On this page, you will be able to find all the latest in Thoth Tech
news and updates!

#### How do we use it?

To create a post on the blog, just create a markdown file and add it to the blog folder under
`/src/content/docs/blog/` and add the following items to the header:

- Title (just a basic overview of the post)
- Date (the date of your post. It needs to be formatted YYYY-MM-DD)
- Author / Authors (some basic information about you)

##### Here is an example header, taken straight from this post

As you can see, under authors there are a few subheadings. Name is the only mandatory field, but to
keep things clear and easy for everyone, please at least add your title, but feel free to add in a
picture as well. Your GitHub profile picture is probably the easiest option. Just drag it from your
profile to another tab and copy the URL.
